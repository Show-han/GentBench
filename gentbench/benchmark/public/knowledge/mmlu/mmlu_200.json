    "problem": "\"In reading the lives of great men, I found that the first victory they won was over themselves... self-discipline with all of them came first.\" -- Harry S. Truman That is the quotation   that had me thinking yesterday. Discipline , in particular self-discipline, is what will get us through most things in life, from writing this simple post to Achieving Greatness for You and I. You may ask, \"Why is discipline important in writing this post?\" For people who have tried writing, you would know how hard it might get sometimes to actually sit down and finish the whole article in one period without getting up every few minutes to get a drink, a snack or toilet break etc. Just with most things in life, often we lack the self-discipline to see us through what we are hoping to do or achieve. One area where self-discipline is clearly important is in losing weight. Some people are constantly looking for quick fix to their weight problem; they will jump at anything that is claimed to help them lose weight in the shortest time. They may lose weight fast, but they will find the result short-term especially if they do not change the way they live and the food they eat. A friend of mine shared his experience going through the journey from 115 kilograms to 56 kilograms in around one year. His journey of losing weight started from a trip with his daughter to the doctor for her check-up. He playfully weighed himself on the weighing machine while his daughter was having the check-up. The doctor saw his weight and made a remark, \"If you maintain that balloon weight, you cannot see your grandchildren.\" That made him decide, \"Enough is enough!\" Not only that, he felt tired easily and his excessive   weight made him feel like a walking balloon. In that moment of awakening, he made decisions to change his lifestyle and eating habits. What does the author mainly talk about in the passage?\nA. His writing hobby.\nB.

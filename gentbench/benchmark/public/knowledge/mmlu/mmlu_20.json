    "problem": "Some people don't mind being fat. Other people can keep slim( ) without any effort.  But a lot of people do put on too much weight and don't like it. The question is : what can they do about it? Some  believe exercise can be helpful. But the trouble is that it only makes you want to eat more. You might sweat out   a couple of pounds playing tennis or climbing a mountain, but you put it all back on again with a big steak or bread and jam. A helpful way is food - choosing.

You' 11 find you need a lot of bananas, and unless you live where they grow, they aren't cheap. Another theory says that if you eat things like hard - boiled eggs, apples with their skins on, and lean meat which are hard for your stomach to digest, the more you eat, the thinner you get. This is because you use up the fat in your body to get the energy to digest the food. For most of us these methods are too extreme  . The simplest way is just to cut down on the carbohydrates; that means not eating bread, potatoes, cakes, sugar, rice , and so on and eating anything else you like.  It' s straight -- forward and often quite effective. Still others like to be more scientific. They are calorie counters. They get a table which tells them that, for example, 100 grams of roast leg of lamb give you 330 calories and a 50 gram of Yorkshire pudding gives you 130 calories.

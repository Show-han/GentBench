    "problem": "For years people had told our founders, motivational speakers Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, inspiring stories about themselves. Jack and Mark included these stories in their talks, and their audiences repeatedly asked if they had ever been published. Eventually, Jack and Mark decided to collect the best 101 stories they'd been told and put them in a book. They called itChicken Soup for the Soulbecause they wanted it to provide comfort, just like their grandmothers' cooking. They took the book to New York, hoping to sell it to one of the big publishers, but every single one turned them down. The project appeared to have _ until they met Peter Vegso. Peter read some of the stories and loved them, so he decided to give the book a chance, becomingChicken Soup for the Soulfounding publisher.

    "problem": "Beijing plans to keep a tight rule on pollution by cutting emissions caused by industrial production and vehicles when it hosts the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in November. From November 3 to 12, the city will restrict the use of private vehicles based on evenand oddnumbered license plates, reducing the use of such vehicles by 35 percent, the municipal   traffic committee said on Thursday. All vehicles transporting construction waste and dangerous chemicals will be banned from the capital's roads during this period, but the restriction will not apply to buses, taxis and other vehicles such as police cars. The measures are similar to those introduced from July 20 to Sept. 20 in 2008 during the Beijing Olympic Games. \"The number of passengers using public transport will increase by 3 million a day, \" said Li Shaoming, deputy director of the Beijing Traffic Management Bureau. During the 10 days, 400 additional buses will be used to transport commuters to meet the increased demands. The municipal government has also drawn up eight plans to reduce industrial pollution during the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation forum. Zhuang Zhidong, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, said, \"From Nov. 3, production at some companies listed by the government will be _ for 10 days.\" Work will also be suspended at all construction sites and on demolition projects during this period. \"More importantly, Beijing will work with its neighbors to control emissions,\" Zhuang said, adding that there will be regular discussion on air pollution among six governments. Neighboring authorities in Tianjin Municipality, Hebei, Shanxi and Shandong Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will operate strict pollution control measures over the 10 days. Media reports said that from Nov. 7 to 12, employee departments, institutes and social organizations in Beijing can have a holiday, except for departments dealing with the APEC meeting and city management.

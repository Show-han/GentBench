    "problem": "Most people who move to a foreign country or culture may go through some form of culture shock,and its degree is determined by the differences between cultures,the anxiety to adapt to a new culture and the familiarity with a new culture,etc.If you go,for example,to a culture that is far different from your own,you're likely to experience culture shock more sharply than those who move to a new culture knowing the language and the custom of it.

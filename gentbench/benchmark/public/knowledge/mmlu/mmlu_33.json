    "problem": "Hank Viscardi was 26 years old when he put on his first pair of long trousers and his first pair of shoes. For the first time he saw himself as he had always wanted to be a full five feet eight inches tall. Hank had been born without legs. Until he was seven, his world was a world of repeated operations. At last he had not legs, but stumps that could be fitted with a kind of special boots. Out of the hospital, Hank often found people staring at him with cruel interest. Children laughed at him and called him \"Ape Man\" because his arms dragged on the ground. He went to school like other boys. His grades were good and he needed only eight years instead of the usual twelve. After graduation, Hank worked his way through college. He swept floors, waited on table, or worked in one of the college offices. During all this busy life, Hank had been moving around on his stumps. But one day the doctor told him even the stumps were not going to last much longer. Hank would soon have to use a wheel chair. Hank felt himself go cold all over. However, the doctor said there was a chance that he could be fitted with artificial legs. Finally a leg maker was found and the day came when Hank stood up before the mirror and saw himself for the first time, five feet eight inches tall. But this was not the end yet. He had to learn to use his new legs. Again and again he marched the length of the room, and marched back again. There were times when he fell down on the floor, but he pulled himself up and went back to the endless marching. He went out on the street. He climbed the stairs and learned to dance.

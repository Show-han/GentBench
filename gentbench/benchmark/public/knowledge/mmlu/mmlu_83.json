    "problem": "Ted, my little brother, is in Grade One. Last Friday he came back from school with a letter.  The letter was from his teacher. \"I got a red flower today. Could you please sign this note?\" he said to Mum. The note showed that he had been talking in class. Ted hardly gets top scores in his school work. The best he gets is \"OK\", but often he gets \"You can do better than this.\" Mum knows what it means. She tells me \"You can do better than this\" means \"Extremely bad\" in China. In the USA, teachers never say anything too bad about their students, even if the students are making trouble in class or not working hard enough. The worst they might say is \"Please be nicer tomorrow\". Many parents are satisfied with--- a B-grade for each subject. But things in Chinese schools are quite different. Parents have _ for their children. I sometimes felt that my second-grade cousin spent more time on homework than I did when I was a 6thgrader in the USA! Yet his parents and teachers didn't think he worked hard enough. Is it too strict in China? Or is it not strict enough in the USA? Maybe both are true. Why did Ted come home with .a letter last Friday ?\nA. Because the teacher wanted to visit his mother.\nB. Because he did something wrong.\nC. Because the teacher was happy with his progress.\nD. Because the teacher thought he was too lazy.\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

    "problem": "Once, looking for stories on the back roads of Ohio,  _ . A beekeeper we'd been told about was away from home when we called on him. An amusement park where we thought we might find a story had shut down for the season. We began to get a little discouraged.          When passing a farmhouse, we found a banner in the front yard. The banner said in huge letters: WELCOME HOME, ROGER! We drove on for a mile or two. Somebody said, \" wonder who Roger is ?\" We turned around, went back and knocked on the door.           Roger was a soldier on his way home from the Vietnam War. His family knew he was coming, but weren't sure what day he was going to arrive. We asked if they 'd mind if we brought the camera into the house. Roger's mother said it would be all right if we could give her a few minutes to fix her hair. We weren't there more than an hour, talking to those people who were all excited about Roger coming home.           That afternooon I wrote a simple story letting Roger represent all the soldiers coming home from war. We sent the film with the story to New York, and the anchorman put it on the Evening News.           Rarely has any of our stories caused such a reaction from viewers. There were dozens of calls from people moved by it, and hundreds of letters came in, some of them suggesting that the story be repeated.           That hour with Roger's family made it a good trip to Ohio, after all. I had done a lot of careful planning for the week's work, but in vain. Then along came a banner in a farmhouse yard.           Back at the office, people asked , \" How do you find these stories ?\"          \"Well,\" I said,\" you do have to work at it.\"          All you really have to do is look out of the window. By saying \" we were suffering a week-long dry spell\", the author means that   _  .\nA. they were suffering dry weather for a week.\nB. they were getting nowhere with their work for a week.\nC. they were having a hard time finding their way for a week.\nD. they were having trouble in spelling for a week.\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

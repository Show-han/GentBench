    "problem": "In March 1987, I started a new magazine called Creating Excellence. It was a very proud moment for me. I'd worked hard for over a year to create it, and the premiere issue   was a real success. Shortly after we mailed 25,000 copies, I received one in the mail. But this one wasn't as beautiful as the ones we'd sent out. It was marked in red ink correcting the grammatical errors   in it. A talented editor had read the issue carefully and found more errors than I could have imagined. I felt _ A magazine called Creating Excellence should be perfect in its content  . The stories were good, but the errors this woman had found showed that we were far from being excellent. At first, I was upset with my editor for not having caught more mistakes, and also upset with the woman who seemed to have taken pleasure in pointing them out. Later, I was upset with myself for not having employed a better editor. Then I realized that I had to face up to my mistakes. I called the woman who had shown me that we were not so excellent. I thanked her for taking the time to read our magazine so carefully. As painful as it was, I accepted responsibility for it. Then I offered her the job of editing our publication. The result was a great improvement in it; we could now be very proud of our magazine. From this I learnt that an upsetting moment could be an opportunity to see the truth, and accepting responsibility could help to prevent one making the same mistakes for a second time, and to make \"excellence\" a reality. What do we learn about the woman who had found the errors in the magazine?\nA. She was causing trouble on purpose.\nB. She liked pointing out the errors of others.\nC. She contributed a lot to the success of the premiere issue.\nD. She ended up joining the magazine.\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

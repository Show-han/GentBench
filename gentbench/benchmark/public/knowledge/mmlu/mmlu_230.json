    "problem": "Celebrities  are more in love with themselves than the average person,according to a new study. In case anyone needed proof, a new study supports the widely held perception:Famous people are more narcissistic ,which means they are more in love with themselves than the average person is.That is the conclusion drawn by Drew Pinsky and S.Mark Young of the University of Southern California,whose study of 200 celebrities will appear in the Journal Of Research in Personality. It is not the entertainment industry that turns stars into narcissists,the study found.Rather, it suggests,the self-adoring people seek jobs in show business.The study, whose subjects were a11 celebrities from Pinsky's'Loveline'radio show, found that reality TV stars were the most narcissistic of all celebrities.Female stars were also more likely than the male stars to exhibit narcissistic characteristics. It's \"common sense\" that celebrities are narcissists,said Jeremy Ritzlin,a longtime Hollywood psychologist who has not seen the study.\"Everyone knows famous people are really in love with themselves,\"he said.\"So it would be natural for narcissists to be attracted toward the stage and spotlight,where other people will also think highly of them.\" Pinsky, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at USC'S Keck School of Medicine,said narcissists desire attention,are overconfident,behave strangely and lack sympathy.\"However, they are easily-liked,especially on first meeting,are outgoing and perform well in public,\" added Pinsky, who has hosted the radio show\"Loveline\"for 20 years. Celebrity guests appearing on the program were randomly chosen to participate in the study.They anonymously took the Narcissistic Personality Inventory test.which rates self-love levels based on seven components:superiority, exhibitionism,entitlement,vanity,authority, exploitativeness,and self-sufficiency.

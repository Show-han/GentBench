    "problem": "Some days, don't you think, \"Wouldn't it be nice if the laundry would just do itself?\" Self-cleaning clothes may sound crazy. But Australian researchers have found a way to make something like this possible! A team at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia, found a way to put special nanostructures   into clothing, which can then clean the clothes. When sunlight hits the nanostructures, they break down the dirt and stains   that don't belong on your clothes. The nanostructures don't break down the actual clothing because cotton and the other clothing materials are too strong to be broken down. According to CNN, the researchers cover the clothing in a solution made of silver and copper   nanostructures. All it takes is 40 minutes of sunlight and your clothes will look as good as new. So if you spill on yourself during lunch, you can step outside for a walk, and it will be clean by the time you go inside. It not only makes your life easier, but it can also be good for the environment. According to the US Department of Energy, the average load of laundry uses about 25 gallons (about 94 liters) of water. Water is a very important resource, so using less of it to wash clothes is better for the environment. But one of the scientists at RMIT University knows more needs to be done. \"There's more work to do before we can start throwing out our washing machines,\" said Dr Rajesh Ramanathan, \"but this is a strong foundation  .\" So what's the next step? Ramanathan wants to either start selling the solution by itself or convincing   clothing makers to treat the clothing with the solution while clothes are being made. What can we learn from the passage?\nA. Silver and copper sell well.\nB. The solution is not put into practice.\nC. Clothing makes certainly like the solution.\nD. We don't need washing machines any more.\nAmong A through D, the answer is",

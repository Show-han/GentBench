    "problem": "Giving a gift can mean a lot. It can be a way to deepen   a friendship. Before you get a gift for someone, spend time really thinking about what makes him or her special. Think about their interests, hobbies, needs and happiest moments. For example, friends and families with children might love a special calendar that contains everyone's birthday and other special dates and events. For music fans, a CD filled   with their favourite music always makes a special gift. Spending time with loved ones is also a way to give them a gift. You might take that special person out for a birthday dinner at your favourite restaurant. Making a gift for someone using your own skills is very special. It is much more meaningful than a store-bought gift and shows how much you care! Writing your feelings in a greeting card can be a simple way to make a keepsake   that will be remembered for years.

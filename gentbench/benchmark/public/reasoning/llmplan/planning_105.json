    "problem": "I am playing with a set of objects. Here are the actions I can do\n\nAttack object. It takes 1 minute to do the Attack action.\nFeast object from another object. It takes 1 minute to do the Feast action.\nSuccumb object. It takes 1 minute to do the Succumb action.\nOvercome object from another object. It takes 1 minute to do the Overcome action.\n\nI have the following restrictions on my actions:\nTo perform Attack action, the following facts need to be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.\nOnce Attack action is performed the following facts will be true: Pain object.\nOnce Attack action is performed the following facts will be false: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.\nTo perform Succumb action, the following facts need to be true: Pain object.\nOnce Succumb action is performed the following facts will be true: Province object, Planet object, Harmony.    \nOnce Succumb action is performed the following facts will be false: Pain object.\nTo perform Overcome action, the following needs to be true: Province other object, Pain object.\nOnce Overcome action is performed the following will be true: Harmony, Pain object, Object Craves other object.\nOnce Overcome action is performed the following will be false: Province other object, Pain object.\nTo perform Feast action, the following needs to be true: Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.\nOnce Feast action is performed the following will be true: Pain object, Province other object.\nOnce Feast action is performed the following will be false:, Object Craves other object, Province object, Harmony.\n\n[STATEMENT]\nAs initial conditions I have that, object b craves object c, object c craves object a, harmony, planet object a, planet object d, planet object e, province object b, province object d and province object e.\nMy goal is to have that object a craves object c, object b craves object e, object c craves object b and object e craves object d.

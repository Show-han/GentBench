    "problem": "In a Geometry exam, Madeline got 2 mistakes which are half as many mistakes as Leo. Brent scored 25 and has 1 more mistake than Leo. What is Madeline's score?",
    "solution": "Leo got 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4 mistakes.\nSo, Brent got 4 + 1 = <<4+1=5>>5 mistakes.\nThis means that 25 + 5 = <<25+5=30>>30 is the perfect score.\nHence, Madeline got a score of 30 - 2 = <<30-2=28>>28.\n#### 28",

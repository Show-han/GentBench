    "problem": "Kate loves painting. She decided to go to an Art-museum in her city. The entrance fee is $5. Kate loved the visit so much, that she decided to go there once a month. After 1 year, the ticket price increased to $7 and Kate decided she is going to visit the museum only 4 times a year. How much did Kate pay for all visits to the Art-museum after 3 years of visiting?",
    "solution": "One year is 12 months, so during the first year, Kate spent $5/month * 12 months/year = $<<5*12=60>>60/year on the tickets.\nAfter that, she went to the museum for 3 years - 1 year = <<3-1=2>>2 more years.\nDuring this time, she visited the museum 2 years * 4 visits/year = <<2*4=8>>8 visits.\nShe had to pay the higher price of $7, so she spent $7/visit * 8 visits = $<<7*8=56>>56 in two last years.\nIn total Kate paid $56 + $60 = $<<56+60=116>>116 during 3 years.\n#### 116",

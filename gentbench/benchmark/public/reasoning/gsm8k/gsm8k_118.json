    "problem": "John has to restring 3 basses with 4 strings each, twice as many guitars which have 6 strings each, and 3 fewer 8 string guitars than the normal guitars.  How many strings does he need?",
    "solution": "The basses take 3*4=<<3*4=12>>12 strings\nHe restrings 2*3=<<2*3=6>>6 normal guitars\nThat takes 6*6=<<6*6=36>>36 strings\nHe restrings 6-3=3 guitars with 8 strings\nSo that uses 3*8=<<3*8=24>>24 strings\nSo he uses 12+36+24=<<12+36+24=72>>72 strings\n#### 72",

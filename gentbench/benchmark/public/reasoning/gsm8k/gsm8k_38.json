    "problem": "To participate in the local community tree-planting campaign, Mr. Julius planted twenty trees of White Oak and twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak on his first day. On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees and 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day. Calculate the total number of trees planted by Mr. Julius in the two days.",
    "solution": "Mr. Julius planted 2 pine/oak * 20 oak = <<2*20=40>>40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.\nOn the second day, he increased the number of White Oak trees planted to 20 trees + 10 trees = <<20+10=30>>30 trees.\nAt the same time, he increased the total number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted by 1/4 * 40 trees = <<1/4*40=10>>10 trees on the second day.\nThe total number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted by Mr. Julius on the second day is 10 trees + 40 trees = <<10+40=50>>50 trees\nMr. Julius planted a total of 50 trees + 30 trees + 40 trees + 20 trees = <<50+30+40+20=140>>140 trees.\n#### 140",

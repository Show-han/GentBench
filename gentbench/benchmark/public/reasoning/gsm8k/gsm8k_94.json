    "problem": "Marta was about to start the school year and needed to buy the necessary textbooks. She managed to buy five on sale, for $10 each. She had to order two textbooks online, which cost her a total of $40, and three she bought directly from the bookstore for a total of three times the cost of the online ordered books. How much in total did Martha spend on textbooks?",
    "solution": "Marta bought five textbooks on sale, for a total of 5 * 10 = $<<5*10=50>>50.\nThree textbooks from the bookstore had a cost of 3 * 40 = $<<3*40=120>>120.\nThat means that Marta spent in total 50 + 40 + 120 = $<<50+40+120=210>>210 on textbooks.\n#### 210",

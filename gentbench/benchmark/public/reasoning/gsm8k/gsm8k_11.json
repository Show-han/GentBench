    "problem": "A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?",
    "solution": "The length of the smaller rectangle is 1/2*40 = <<1/2*40=20>>20 meters.\nThe width of the smaller rectangle is 1/2*20 = <<1/2*20=10>>10 meters.\nSince the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length times the width, the total area of the smaller rectangle is 20*10 = <<20*10=200>>200 meters square.\n#### 200",

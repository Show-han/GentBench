    "problem": "If a tarantula has eight legs, and one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, how many baby tarantula legs would be in one less than 5 egg sacs?",
    "solution": "One less than 5 is 5-1=<<5-1=4>>4.\nIf one tarantula egg sac can contain 1000 tarantulas, then four egg sacs can hold 4*1000=4000 tarantula babies.\nIf each tarantula baby has eight legs, the 4 egg sacs can contain 4000*8=<<4000*8=32000>>32,000 baby tarantula legs.\n#### 32000",

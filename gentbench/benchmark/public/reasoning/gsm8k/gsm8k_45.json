    "problem": "Julie, Letitia and Anton decided to have dinner together at a nearby restaurant.  Julie orders $10 worth of food, Letitia orders $20 worth of food, and Anton orders $30 worth of food.  How much should each pay in tips if they want to split a 20% tip for the whole meal evenly?",
    "solution": "First, we need to determine how much the entire meal costs before we can determine the tip. We perform 10+20+30=<<10+20+30=60>>60 dollars worth of food.\nNow we need to find out how much the total tip to be paid is, by multiplying 60*.2=12 dollars in tips.\nSince they want to split this evenly amongst three people, this works out to 12/3= <<12/3=4>>4 dollars in tips per person.\n#### 4",

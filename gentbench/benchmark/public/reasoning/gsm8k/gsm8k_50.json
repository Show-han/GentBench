    "problem": "Florida is starting a promotion where every car that arrives gets one orange per passenger. A family of 4 arrives and gets their oranges. They had planned to stop for a snack later where they would spend $15 in total, but now that they have the oranges they don't have to buy them at the stop. When they get to the stop they see that the oranges would've cost $1.5 each. What percentage of the money they planned to spend did they save instead?",
    "solution": "The oranges would've cost $6 because 4 x 1.5 = <<4*1.5=6>>6\nThe proportion of their original spending plan was .4 because 6 / 15 = <<6/15=.4>>.4\nThey saved 40% of the money they planned to spend because .4 x 100 = <<.4*100=40>>40\n#### 40",

    "problem": "A restaurant is offering a fundraiser one day where they donate $2 for every $10  donated by customers. The average customer donates 3 and there are 40 customers that day. How much does the restaurant donate?",
    "solution": "Customer donated a total of $120 because 40 x 3 = <<40*3=120>>120\nThey got $10 a total of 12 times because 120 / 10 = <<120/10=12>>12\nThey donated $24 because 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24\n#### 24",

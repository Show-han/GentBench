    "problem": "Janet needs 5 tickets to ride the roller coaster and 3 tickets to ride the giant slide. How many tickets does she need to ride the roller coaster 7 times and the giant slide 4 times?",
    "solution": "First find how many tickets she needs for the roller coaster: 5 tickets/ride * 7 rides = <<5*7=35>>35 tickets\nThen find how many tickets she needs for the giant slide: 3 tickets/ride * 4 rides = <<3*4=12>>12 tickets\nThen add the number of tickets she needs for each ride to find the total number of tickets she needs: 12 tickets + 35 tickets = <<12+35=47>>47 tickets\n#### 47",

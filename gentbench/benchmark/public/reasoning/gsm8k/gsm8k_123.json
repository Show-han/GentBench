    "problem": "Eliana walked 200 steps for her morning exercise, did some press-ups, then added some 300 more steps to her count for the first day. The next day, she walked twice the number of steps she walked on the first day.  And on the third day, Eliana walked an additional 100 steps. What's the total number of steps Eliana walked during these three days?",
    "solution": "On the first day, she walks 200 + 300 = <<200+300=500>>500 steps.\nThe next day she walks twice the steps, which is 2*500 = <<2*500=1000>>1000\nThe total number of steps after the two days are 1000+500 = <<1000+500=1500>>1500\nOn the third day, she walks an additional 100 steps, bringing the three-day total to 1500+100=<<1500+100=1600>>1600 steps\n#### 1600",

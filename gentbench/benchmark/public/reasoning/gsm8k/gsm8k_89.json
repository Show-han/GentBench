    "problem": "Iris went to the mall to buy clothes.  She bought three jackets at $10 each, two pairs of shorts at $6 each, and four pairs of pants at $12 each. How much did she spend in all?",
    "solution": "Three jackets cost 3 x $10 = $<<3*10=30>>30.\nTwo pairs of shorts cost 2 x $6 = $<<2*6=12>>12.\nAnd, four pairs of pants cost 4 x $12 = $<<4*12=48>>48.\nTherefore, Iris spent $30 + $12 + $48 = $<<30+12+48=90>>90.\n#### 90",

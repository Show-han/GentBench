    "problem": "Mikey likes his honey cluster of oats cereal.  In each spoonful, there are 4 clusters of oats.  In each bowl of cereal, he gets 25 spoonfuls of cereal.  If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, how many bowlfuls of cereal are in each box?",
    "solution": "If each spoonful contains 4 clusters of oats, and each bowl of cereal has 25 spoonfuls, then in each bowl there are 4*25=<<4*25=100>>100 clusters of oats.\nAnd If each box of cereal contains 500 clusters of oats, then there are 500/100=<<500/100=5>>5 bowlfuls of cereal in every box.\n#### 5",

    "problem": "Mother made 2 dozen brownies and placed them on the kitchen counter to cool.  Father smelled the brownies, came into the kitchen and ate 8 of them. Then, their daughter, Mooney, wandered into the kitchen and ate 4 of the brownies. The next morning, Mother made another two dozen brownies and added them to those remaining from the day before.  After that, how many brownies were on the counter?",
    "solution": "Two dozen brownies is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 brownies.\nAfter Father ate his 8, there were 24 - 8 = <<24-8=16>>16 brownies remaining on the counter.\nAfter Mooney ate her 4, there were 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 brownies remaining on the counter.\nMother made a second batch of two-dozen brownies, or 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 brownies.\nAfter Mother added the second two-dozen, there were 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 brownies on the kitchen counter.\n#### 36",

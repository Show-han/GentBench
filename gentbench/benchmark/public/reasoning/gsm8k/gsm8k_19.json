    "problem": "To get free delivery, Alice needs to spend a minimum of $35.00 online at her favorite grocery store.  In her cart she has 1.5 pounds of chicken at $6.00 per pound, 1 pack of lettuce for $3.00, cherry tomatoes for $2.50, 4 sweet potatoes at $0.75 each, 2 heads of broccoli for $2.00 each and a pound of Brussel sprouts for $2.50.  How much more does she need to spend in order to get free delivery?",
    "solution": "She bought 1.5 pounds of chicken for $6.00/pound so that's 1.5*$6 = $<<1.5*6=9.00>>9.00\nShe bought 4 sweet potatoes at $0.75 each so that's 4*$0.75 = $<<4*0.75=3.00>>3.00\nShe bought 2 heads of broccoli for $2.00 each so that's 2*$2 = $<<2*2=4.00>>4.00\nThe chicken is $9.00, lettuce is $3.00, tomatoes are $2.50, the sweet potatoes are $3.00, broccoli is $4.00 and Brussel sprouts are $2.50 for a total of $9 + $3 + $2.50 + $3 + $4 + $2.5 = $<<9+3+2.5+3+4+2.5=24.00>>24.00\nTo get free delivery she needs to spend $35.00, and she already has $24.00 in her cart, so she needs to spend an extra $35-$24 = $<<35-24=11.00>>11.00\n#### 11",

    "problem": "Kimberly went strawberry picking with her family over the weekend. She picked 8 times the amount of strawberries her brother picked and her parents picked 93 strawberries less than her. If her brother picked 3 baskets each containing 15 strawberries, how many strawberries would they each have if they divide the total number of strawberries equally amongst them?",
    "solution": "Kimberly's brother picked 3 x 15 = <<3*15=45>>45 strawberries.\nKimberly picked 8 x 45 = <<8*45=360>>360 strawberries.\nKimberly's parents picked 360 - 93 = <<360-93=267>>267 strawberries.\nAltogether, they picked 45 + 360 + 267 = <<45+360+267=672>>672 strawberries.\nEach of them will have 672/4 = <<672/4=168>>168 strawberries.\n#### 168",

    "problem": "Isabelle gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her two brothers. Her ticket costs $20. Her brothers both get the children\u2019s discount, and each of their tickets cost $10. Her brothers have saved $5 between the two of them and Isabelle has saved $5. If her job pays $3 per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?",
    "solution": "The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $10 * 2 = $<<10*2=20>>20.\nTo buy tickets for all of them, it will cost Isabelle $20 + $20 = $<<20+20=40>>40.\nBetween all of them, they have saved a total of $5 + $5 = $<<5+5=10>>10.\nSince they have already saved $10, she needs to earn an additional $40 - $10 = $<<30=30>>30 to afford the tickets.\nSince she makes $3 per week, it will take her $30 / ($3/week) = <<30/(3)=10>>10 weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets.\n#### 10",

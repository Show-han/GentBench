    "problem": "Kyle can lift 60 more pounds this year, which is 3 times as much as he could lift last year. How many pounds can Kyle lift in all?",
    "solution": "Since Kyle can lift 60 more pounds and that is 3 times what he could do before, that means that last year Kyle could lift 60 pounds / 3 = <<60/3=20>>20 pounds.\nKyle can now lift 60 pounds + 20 pounds he could lift last year = <<60+20=80>>80 pounds.\n#### 80",

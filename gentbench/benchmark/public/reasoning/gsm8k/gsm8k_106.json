    "problem": "The average speed for an hour drive is 66 miles per hour. If Felix wanted to drive twice as fast for 4 hours, how many miles will he cover?",
    "solution": "If Felix drives twice as fast, he will be covering 2*66 = <<2*66=132>>132 miles per hour.\nIn four hours, driving at 132 miles per hour, since distance=speed*time, Felix will cover 132*4 = <<132*4=528>>528 miles.\n#### 528",

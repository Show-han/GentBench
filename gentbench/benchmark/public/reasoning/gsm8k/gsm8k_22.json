    "problem": "Cassandra bought four dozen Granny Smith apples and used them to make four apple pies.  She cut each pie into 6 large pieces.  How many apples are in each slice of pie?",
    "solution": "Four dozen apples contain 4*12=<<4*12=48>>48 apples.\nFour pies, each cut into 6 pieces, contain 4*6=<<4*6=24>>24 pieces.\nThus, there are 48/24=<<48/24=2>>2 apples in every slice of Cassandra's apple pie.\n#### 2",

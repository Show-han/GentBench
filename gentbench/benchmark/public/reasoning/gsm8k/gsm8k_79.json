    "problem": "Jon makes 3/4's the salary that Karen makes. John makes $3000 per month. How long will it take him to make the same amount of money that Karen does in 3 months?",
    "solution": "Karen makes $3000 / (3/4) = $<<3000/(3/4)=4000>>4000 per month.\nIn three months, Karen would make a total of $4000 * 3 = $<<4000*3=12000>>12000.\nTo make the same amount of money John would need to work $12000 / $3000 = <<12000/3000=4>>4 months.\n#### 4",

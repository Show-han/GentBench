    "problem": "Tom has a quarter as much money as Nataly. Nataly has three times as much money as Raquel. How much money do Tom, Raquel, and Nataly have combined if Raquel has $40?",
    "solution": "If Nataly has 3 times as much money as Raquel, she has 3 * $40 = $<<3*40=120>>120\nTom has 1/4 as much money as Nataly, so he has 1/4 * $120 = $<<1/4*120=30>>30\nCombined, the three have $30 + $120 + $40 = $<<30+120+40=190>>190\n#### 190",

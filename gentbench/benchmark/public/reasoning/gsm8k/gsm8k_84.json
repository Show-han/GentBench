    "problem": "Dean ordered 2 large pizzas that were each cut into 12 slices.  His friends Frank and Sammy came over to enjoy some pizza and watch a movie.  Dean was hungry and ate half of the Hawaiian pizza.  Frank only ate 3 slices of Hawaiian pizza and Sammy ate a third of the cheese pizza.  How many total slices were left over?",
    "solution": "2 pizzas were ordered and had 12 slices each for a total of 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 slices\nDean ate 1/2 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 slices were left over\nSammy ate 1/3 of a 12 sliced pizza so 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 slices were left over\nDean ate 6 slices, Sammy ate 4 and Frank had 3 so 6+4+3 = <<6+4+3=13>>13\nThey started with 24 slices and 13 slices so 24-13 = <<24-13=11>>11 slices left\n#### 11",

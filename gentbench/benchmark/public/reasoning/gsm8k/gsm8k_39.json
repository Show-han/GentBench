    "problem": "Sweet Hope hosts a casino with 3 roulette tables labeled A, B, and C. At 6:00 pm, Table B had twice as much money on it as table C, which had $20 more than table A. If there was $40 on table A, how much money was there on all the tables?",
    "solution": "If table C had $20 more than table A, then table C had $20+$40=$<<20+40=60>>60\nRoulette tables A and C had $60+$40=$<<60+40=100>>100\nTable B had twice as much money on it as table C, meaning table B had $60*2=$<<60*2=120>>120\nTogether, the three roulette tables had $120+$100=$<<120+100=220>>220\n#### 220",

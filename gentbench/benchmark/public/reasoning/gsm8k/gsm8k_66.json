    "problem": "Felix can lift off the ground 1.5 times more than he weighs. Felix's brother weighs twice as much as Felix and can lift three times his weight off the ground. If his brother can lift 600 pounds, how much can Felix lift off the ground?",
    "solution": "Felix's brother weighs 200 pounds because 600 / 3 = <<600/3=200>>200\nFelix weighs 100 pounds because 200 / 2 = <<200/2=100>>100\nFelix can lift 150 pounds because 100 x 1.5 = <<100*1.5=150>>150\n#### 150",

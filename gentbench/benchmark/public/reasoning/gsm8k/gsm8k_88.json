    "problem": "There is a fruit display that has apples, oranges, and bananas.  There are twice as many apples as oranges, and there are twice as many oranges as bananas.  How many fruits are on the display in total if there are 5 bananas on the display?",
    "solution": "We start by finding out that since there are twice as many oranges as the 5 bananas, this means there are 5*2=<<5*2=10>>10 oranges.\nSince there are twice as many apples as the 10 oranges, this means there 10*2=<<10*2=20>>20 apples.\nIn total, this means there are 20+10+5= <<20+10+5=35>>35 fruits on the display.\n#### 35",

    "problem": "Janet buys a brooch for her daughter.  She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it.  After that, she pays 10% of that to get it insured.  How much did she pay?",
    "solution": "The total cost of the broch was 500+800=$<<500+800=1300>>1300\nThe insurance was 1300*.1=$<<1300*.1=130>>130\nSo she pays 1300+130=$<<1300+130=1430>>1430\n#### 1430",

    "problem": "Kekai's family is having a garage sale. Kekai sells 5 shirts and 5 pairs of pants. Each shirt sells for $1, and each pair of pants sells for $3. If Kekai gives his parents half of the money he earns from selling his clothes, how much money does Kekai have left?",
    "solution": "From selling his shirts, Kekai makes 5 * $1 = $<<5*1=5>>5\nFrom selling his pants, Kekai makes 5 * $3 = $<<5*3=15>>15\nThe total amount of money Kekai earns is $5 + $15 = $<<5+15=20>>20\nSince Kekai gives half of the money to his parents, he has $20 / 2 = $<<20/2=10>>10 left\n#### 10",

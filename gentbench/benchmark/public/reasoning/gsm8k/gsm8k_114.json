    "problem": "On national lipstick day, half of the students who attended class wore colored lipstick.  Of those students who wore lipstick, one quarter wore red lipstick.  There were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as were wearing red lipstick.  If 200 students attended school that day, how many wore blue lipstick?",
    "solution": "Of 200 students who attended class, half wore colored lipstick, or 200/2=<<200/2=100>>100 students wore colored lipstick.\nOf those students who wore lipstick, one quarter wore red lipstick, or 100/4=<<100/4=25>>25 students wore red lipstick.\nSince there were one-fifth as many students wearing blue lipstick as were wearing red lipstick, then 25/5=<<25/5=5>>5 students wore blue lipstick.\n#### 5",

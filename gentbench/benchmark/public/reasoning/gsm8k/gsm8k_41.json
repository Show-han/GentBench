    "problem": "Half of Jerome's money was $43. He gave $8 to Meg and thrice as much to Bianca. How much does Jerome have left?",
    "solution": "Jerome has $43 x 2 = $<<43*2=86>>86.\nAfter giving Meg $8, he had only $86 - $8 = $<<86-8=78>>78 left.\nThen he gave Bianca $8 x 3 = $<<8*3=24>>24.\nSo, Jerome has only $78 - $24 = $<<78-24=54>>54 left.\n#### 54",

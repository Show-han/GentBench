    "problem": "Adam had a farm with animals. He had 12 cows and twice as many sheep. He decided to buy 3 pigs for every sheep he had. How many animals were on the farm after the transaction?",
    "solution": "Adam had twice as many sheep as the cows, so 2 sheep/cow * 12 cows = <<2*12=24>>24 sheep.\nFor every sheep, he bought 3 pigs, so he bought 3 pigs/sheep * 24 sheep = <<3*24=72>>72 pigs.\nIn total on the farm, there were 72 pigs + 24 sheep + 12 cows = <<72+24+12=108>>108 animals.\n#### 108",

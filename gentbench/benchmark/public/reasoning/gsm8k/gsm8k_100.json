    "problem": "Rob, Royce, and Pedro are contractors getting ready to put a new roof on three homes. If the three homes will need 250 cases of shingles, with the first house needing 1/2 of the second, and the third needing double the first. How many cases of shingles will the third house need?",
    "solution": "Let x be the number of cases of shingles for the second house\nThe first house needs 1/2 x cases of shingles\nThe third house needs 2(1/2)x=x cases of shingles\n250=x+x+(1/2)x\n250=(5/2)x\n250(2/5)=100=x\nThe third house needs 100 cases of shingles\n#### 100",

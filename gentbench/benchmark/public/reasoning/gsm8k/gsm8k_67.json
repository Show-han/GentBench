    "problem": "Mr. and Mrs. McPherson have to renew their rent by the end of the year. They agreed that Mrs. McPherson would raise 30% of the money. If their rent is $1200 per year, how much does Mr. McPherson need to raise to complete the rent?",
    "solution": "30% of $1200 is (30/100)*$1200 = $<<(30/100)*1200=360>>360\nMrs. McPherson will pay $360 leaving $1200-$360 = $<<1200-360=840>>840 which Mr. McPherson will have to raise\n#### 840",

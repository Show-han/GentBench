    "problem": "James can do a farmer's walk with 300 pounds per hand for 20 meters.  He can lift 30% more if he only goes 10 meters.  In addition, lifting straps give him another 20%.  How much can he move with lifting straps for 10 meters if he increases his 20-meter distance without straps by 50 pounds and everything else increases in proportion?",
    "solution": "After the increase, he can lift 300+50=<<300+50=350>>350 pounds\nDecreasing the distance increase the amount he can lift by 350*.3=<<350*.3=105>>105 pounds\nSo he can lift 350+105=<<350+105=455>>455 for 10 feet\nThe straps add another 455*.2=<<455*.2=91>>91 pounds\nSo his total weight is 455+91=<<455+91=546>>546 pounds per hand\n#### 546",

    "problem": "If Jenna has twice as much money in her bank account as Phil does, and Phil has one-third the amount of money that Bob has in his account, and Bob has $60 in his account, how much less money does Jenna have in her account than Bob?",
    "solution": "If Phil has one-third of the amount that Bob does, that means he has $60/3= $<<60/3=20>>20 in his account.\nSince Jenna has twice as much money as Phil, that means she has $20*2= <<20*2=40>>40 in her account.\nSince Bob has $60 in his account, that means he has $60-$40=$<<60-40=20>>20 more than Jenna.\n#### 20",

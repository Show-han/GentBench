    "problem": "Gary bought a boat for $9000.  Over the first year it depreciated 30%.  The second year it depreciated another 30%.  The third year it depreciated 20%.  How much is the boat worth after the three years?",
    "solution": "After first year:9000(.30)=2700\n9000-2700=<<9000-2700=6300>>6300\nAfter second year:6300(.30)=1890\n6300-1890=<<6300-1890=4410>>4410\nAfter third year:4410(.20)=882\n4410-882=<<4410-882=3528>>3528$\n#### 3528",

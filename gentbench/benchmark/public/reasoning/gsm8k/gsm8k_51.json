    "problem": "Mark got a 5% raise at his job.  Before the raise, he earned 40 dollars per hour.  He works 8 hours per day for 5 days per week.  His old bills used to be 600 dollars a week but he decided to add a hundred dollar a week personal trainer.  How much does he have leftover a week?",
    "solution": "After the raise he earns 40*1.05=<<40*1.05=42>>42 dollars an hour\nHe works 8 hours per day so earns 42*8=<<8*42=336>>336 per day\nHe works 5 days per week so he earns 336*5=<<336*5=1680>>1680 a week\nHis expenses after adding the personal trainer are 600+100=<<600+100=700>>700 a week\nSo he has 1680-700=<<1680-700=980>>980 left over\n#### 980",

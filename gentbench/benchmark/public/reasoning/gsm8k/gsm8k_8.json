    "problem": "Noah, who loves his Grammy, calls her every week to talk about his day. If each call lasts 30 minutes and he is charged $0.05 per call minute, how much would he be billed if he makes the calls for a year?",
    "solution": "A year has 52 weeks, so if he talks for 30 minutes every week, the total number of call hours is 52*30 = <<52*30=1560>>1560 minutes.\nSince he is charged 0.05 cents per call, the total cost is 1560*.05 = <<1560*.05=78>>78 dollars\n#### 78",

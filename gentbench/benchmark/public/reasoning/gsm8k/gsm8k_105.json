    "problem": "Rhea buys 2 trays of eggs every week for her family. Her son and daughter eat 2 eggs every morning, and Rhea and her husband eat 4 eggs every night. If each tray has 24 eggs, how many eggs are not being eaten every week?",
    "solution": "Rhea buys a total of 24 x 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 eggs every week.\nHer son and daughter eat 2 x 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 eggs every week.\nRhea and her husband eat 4 x 7= <<4*7=28>>28 eggs every week.\nSo, the total eggs they eat is 28 + 14 = <<28+14=42>>42.\nTherefore, the total number of eggs that are not being eaten is 48 - 42 = <<48-42=6>>6.\n#### 6",

    "problem": "There is one set of twins and one set of triplets. One twin is 7 years older than one triplet. If their combined ages are 44, how old is one of the twins?",
    "solution": "Let T = age of triplet\nTwin's age = T + <<+7=7>>7\nTwin's combined age = 2 * (T + 7)\nTriplet's combined age = <<3=3>>3T\n2 * (T + 7) + 3T = 44\n2T + 14 + 3T = 44\n5T + 14 = 44\n5T = 30\nT = <<6=6>>6\nTwin = 6 + 7 = <<6+7=13>>13\nThe twins are each <<13=13>>13 years old.\n#### 13",

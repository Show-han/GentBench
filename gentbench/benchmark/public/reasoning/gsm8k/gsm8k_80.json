    "problem": "There are 10 bags with 30 oranges each on a truck. A total of 50 pieces of oranges are rotten. Thirty pieces of oranges will be kept for making orange juice and the rest will be sold. How many pieces of oranges will be sold?",
    "solution": "There are a total of 10 x 30 = <<10*30=300>>300 pieces of oranges in a truck.\nA total of 50 + 30 = <<50+30=80>>80 pieces of oranges will not be sold.\nThus, 300 - 80 = <<300-80=220>>220 pieces of oranges will be sold.\n#### 220",

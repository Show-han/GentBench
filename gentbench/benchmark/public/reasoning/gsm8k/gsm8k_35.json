    "problem": "Judson, Camilo, and Kenny decided to contribute money to paint their house. Judson contributed $500, Kenny contributed 20% more money than Judson, and Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny. How much was the cost of painting the house?",
    "solution": "If Judson paid $500, Kenny contributed 20/100*$500 = $<<500*20/100=100>>100 more than Judson.\nIn total, Kenny contributed $500+$100 = $<<500+100=600>>600\nKenny and Judson contributed a total of $600+$500 = $<<600+500=1100>>1100\nIf Camilo contributed $200 more than Kenny, then he contributed $600+$200 = $800\nThe total amount of money the three contributed for the house painting is $1100+$800 = $<<1100+800=1900>>1900\n#### 1900",

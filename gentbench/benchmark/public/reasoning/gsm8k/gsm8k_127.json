    "problem": "Bob, Tom, Sally, and Jerry had dinner at their favorite pizzeria. They decide to share 2 pizzas. Bob ate half of a pizza on his own. Tom ate one-third of a pizza. Sally wasn't very hungry and only ate one-sixth of a pizza, and Jerry ate a quarter of a pizza. If each pizza is cut into 12 slices, how many slices were left over?",
    "solution": "Each pizza is 12 slices. Bob at 12 slices / 2 = <<12/2=6>>6 slices.\nTom ate one third, or 12 slices / 3 = <<12/3=4>>4 slices.\nSally ate one sixth, or 12 slices / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 slices.\nJerry ate one quarter, or 12 slices / 4 = <<12/4=3>>3 slices.\nIn total, they ate 6 slices + 4 slices + 2 slices + 3 slices = <<6+4+2+3=15>>15 slices.\nSo they were left with 12 slices per pizza * 2 pizzas - 15 slices = 24 slices - 15 slices = <<12*2-15=9>>9 slices.\n#### 9",

    "problem": "James visits 20 houses to try and make a sale.  He manages to sell something in every house.  The next day he visits twice as many houses but only sold to 80% of houses.  If he sold two things at each house in each of the two days, how many items did he sell?",
    "solution": "The second day he visited 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 houses\nSo he sold things at 40*.8=<<40*.8=32>>32 houses\nSo in total he sold things at 20+32=<<20+32=52>>52 houses\nThat means he sold 52*2=<<52*2=104>>104 things\n#### 104",

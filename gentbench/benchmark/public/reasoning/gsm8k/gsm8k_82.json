    "problem": "The number of cards in a card game was 500. Two friends Ellis and Orion, playing together, divided the cards in the ratio of 11:9. How many more cards did Ellis get than Orion?",
    "solution": "The total ratio representing the 500 cards is 11+9 = <<11+9=20>>20\nThe fraction of the total ratio that represents the number of cards that Ellis got is 11/20, and since there were 500 cards, Ellis got 11/20*500 = <<11/20*500=275>>275\nIf there were 500 cards, and Ellis received 275 cards, Orion received 500-275 = <<500-275=225>>225 cards\nThe number of cards that Ellis received more than Orion is 275-225 = <<275-225=50>>50 cards.\n#### 50",

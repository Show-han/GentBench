    "problem": "Kim's dad would buy her 2 candy bars a week.  She would eat 1 candy bar every 4 weeks, saving the rest.  After 16 weeks, how many candy bars did Kim have saved?",
    "solution": "Kim got 2 candy bars a week for 16 weeks so she got 2*16 = <<2*16=32>>32 candy bars\nShe would only eat 1 candy bar every 4 weeks so in 16 weeks she only ate 16/4 = <<16/4=4>>4 candy bars\nShe saved 32 candy bars and only ate 4 so she still has 32-4 = <<32-4=28>>28 candy bars\n#### 28",

    "problem": "A 20 person classroom is filled with 40% girls. If 5 new boys join the classroom, what is the new percentage of girls in the class?",
    "solution": "The number of girls in the classroom is 20 * 40% = <<20*40*.01=8>>8 girls\nBefore new boys join, the number of boys in the classroom is 20 - 8 = <<20-8=12>>12 boys\nIf 5 new boys join, the new number of boys is 12+5=17 boys and the new total is 20+5=25 total people\nThe new percentage of girls in the class is 8 girls / 25 total people = 32%\n#### 32",

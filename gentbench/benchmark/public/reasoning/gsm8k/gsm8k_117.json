    "problem": "Miles and Daphne are comparing their reading collection and want to figure out who has more pages. They are about to count each page, but their parents suggest that they see whose collection is taller. Mile's collection is taller, but then Daphne notices that Miles reads board books, and so the pages are thicker. After some more measuring, they figure out that for Miles, 1 inch equals 5 pages, but for Daphne 1 inch equals 50 pages. If Miles's books are 240 inches tall and Daphne's collection is 25 inches tall, how many pages are in the longest collection?",
    "solution": "Miles's collection has 1,200 pages because 240 x 5 = <<240*5=1200>>1,200\nDaphne's collection has 1,250 pages because 25 x 50 = <<25*50=1250>>1,250\nThe largest collection has 1,250 pages because 1,250 > 1,200\n#### 1250",

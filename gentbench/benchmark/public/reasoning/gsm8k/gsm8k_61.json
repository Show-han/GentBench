    "problem": "Miley bought two cellphones for her parents. Each cellphone costs $800 but, since she is buying two units, she will receive a 5% discount for the total cost. How much did Miley pay?",
    "solution": "Two cellphones cost $800 x 2 = $<<800*2=1600>>1600.\nThe 5% discount amounts to $1600 x 5/100 = $<<1600*5/100=80>>80.\nSo Miley paid $1600 - $80 = $<<1600-80=1520>>1520.\n#### 1520",

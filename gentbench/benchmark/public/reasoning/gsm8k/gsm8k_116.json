    "problem": "Rachel is twice as old as Rona and Collete's age is half the age of Rona's. If Rona is 8 years old, what is the difference between the age of Collete and Rachel?",
    "solution": "Rachel's age is 8 x 2 = <<8*2=16>>16.\nCollete's age is 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4.\nTherefore the difference between their age is 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12.\n#### 12",

    "problem": "Ray always takes the same route when he walks his dog. First, he walks 4 blocks to the park. Then he walks 7 blocks to the high school. Finally, he walks 11 blocks to get back home. Ray walks his dog 3 times each day. How many blocks does Ray's dog walk each day?",
    "solution": "The number of blocks in each walk around the neighborhood is 4 blocks + 7 blocks + 11 blocks = <<4+7+11=22>>22.\nRay's dog walks 3 walks \u00d7 22 blocks/walk = <<3*22=66>>66 blocks each day.\n#### 66",

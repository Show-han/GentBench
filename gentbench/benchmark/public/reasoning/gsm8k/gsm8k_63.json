    "problem": "Collin learned that he could earn $0.25 per aluminum can that he brought into the recycling center.  He found 12 cans at home and three times as many at his grandparents' house.   His neighbor gave him 46.  His dad brought home 250 cans from the office.  His dad told him he could keep the money from the cans he brought home from the office if he promised to put half of his entire amount collected into savings.  How much money would Collin have to put into savings?",
    "solution": "He found 12 and his grandparents gave him three times that amount so he got 12*3 = <<12*3=36>>36 cans from his grandparents\nAll total he collected 12 cans, the 36 from his grandparents, 46 from the neighbor and 250 from his dad for a total of 12+36+46+250 = <<12+36+46+250=344>>344 cans\nEach can is worth $0.25 so .25*344 = $<<.25*344=86.00>>86.00\nHe agreed to put half of the $86 earned into savings so he will save 86/2=$<<86/2=43.00>>43.00\n#### 43",

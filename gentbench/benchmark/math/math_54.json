{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If $n$ is a positive integer, then let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$?", "solution": "The sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is the sum of the digits of the integer $\\frac{10^n}{5^{{}^n}} = 2^n$, since multiplying by $10^n$ simply shifts all the digits $n$ places to the left. As a result, we start computing powers of 2, looking for an integer which has digits summing to a number greater than 10. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128\n\\end{align*}The sum of the digits in 128 is 11. The smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits of $\\frac{1}{5^{{}^n}}$ that are to the right of the decimal point is greater than 10 is $n = \\boxed{7}$.", "pred": "To find $f(n)$, we need to find the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{5^n}$ and sum the digits to the right of the decimal point. \n\nWe know that $\\frac{1}{5^n}$ is equal to $0.2^n$. \n\nTo find the decimal representation of $0.2^n$, we can repeatedly multiply by $0.2$. \n\nStarting with $0.2$, we multiply by $0.2$ to get $0.04$. \n\nMultiplying $0.04$ by $0.2$ gives $0.008$. \n\nContinuing this process, we find that $0.2^n$ is equal to $0.2^n = 0.2 \\cdot 0.2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot 0.2 = 0.2^n$. \n\nTherefore, the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{5^n}$ is $0.2^n$. \n\nTo find $f(n)$, we need to sum the digits to the right of the decimal point. \n\nSince $0.2^n$ is a decimal less than $1$, the sum of the digits to the right of the decimal point is equal to the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of $0.2^n$. \n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of $0.2^n$ is greater than $10$. \n\nWe can find this by calculating the decimal representation of $0.2^n$ for increasing values of $n$ until we find a value of $n$ that gives a sum of digits greater than $10$. \n\nStarting with $n = 1$, we find that $0.2^1 = 0.2$, which has a sum of digits equal to $2$. \n\nIncreasing $n$ to $2$, we find that $0.2^2 = 0.04$, which has a sum of digits equal to $4$. \n\nIncreasing $n$ to $3$, we find that $0.2^3 = 0.008$, which has a sum of digits equal to $8$. \n\nIncreasing $n$ to $4$, we find that $0.2^4 = 0.0016$, which has a sum of digits equal to $16$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $f(n) > 10$ is $\\boxed{4}$."}

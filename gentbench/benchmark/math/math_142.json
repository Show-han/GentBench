{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A very large number $x$ is equal to $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. What is the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square?", "solution": "For the product to be a perfect square, all the exponents need to be even. So we don't need to worry about factors that already have even exponents. We also don't need to worry about $9^9$ because $9$ is already a perfect square. The remaining factors are $3^35^57^7$.\n\nTo get even exponents in the product, we need at least one more $3$, at least one more $5$, and at least one more $7$. That would bring us up to $3^45^67^8$, and everything would be good. And indeed, $3\\cdot5\\cdot7=\\boxed{105}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a perfect square, we need to determine the prime factorization of $x$ and then find the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, cancels out any odd powers of the prime factors.\n\nThe prime factorization of $x$ is $2^23^34^45^56^67^78^89^9$. To make the product a perfect square, we need to cancel out any odd powers of the prime factors. \n\nFor the prime factor $2$, we need to multiply $x$ by $2^3$ to cancel out the odd power of $2$. \nFor the prime factor $3$, we need to multiply $x$ by $3^3$ to cancel out the odd power of $3$. \nFor the prime factor $4$, we need to multiply $x$ by $4^2$ to cancel out the odd power of $4$. \nFor the prime factor $5$, we need to multiply $x$ by $5$ to cancel out the odd power of $5$. \nFor the prime factor $6$, we need to multiply $x$ by $6$ to cancel out the odd power of $6$. \nFor the prime factor $7$, we need to multiply $x$ by $7$ to cancel out the odd power of $7$. \nFor the prime factor $8$, we need to multiply $x$ by $8$ to cancel out the odd power of $8$. \nFor the prime factor $9$, we need to multiply $x$ by $9$ to cancel out the odd power of $9$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that, when multiplied with $x$, produces a product that is a perfect square is $2^33^35^26^27^29^2 = \\boxed{2^33^35^26^27^29^2}$."}

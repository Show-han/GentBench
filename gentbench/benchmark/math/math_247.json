{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A triangular array of numbers has a first row consisting of the odd integers $1,3,5,\\ldots,99$ in increasing order. Each row below the first has one fewer entry than the row above it, and the bottom row has a single entry. Each entry in any row after the top row equals the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the row immediately above it. How many entries in the array are multiples of $67$?\n", "solution": "Let the $k$th number in the $n$th row be $a(n,k)$. Writing out some numbers, we find that $a(n,k) = 2^{n-1}(n+2k-2)$.[1]\nWe wish to find all $(n,k)$ such that $67| a(n,k) = 2^{n-1} (n+2k-2)$. Since $2^{n-1}$ and $67$ are relatively prime, it follows that $67|n+2k-2$. Since every row has one less element than the previous row, $1 \\le k \\le 51-n$ (the first row has $50$ elements, the second $49$, and so forth; so $k$ can range from $1$ to $50$ in the first row, and so forth). Hence\n$n+2k-2 \\le n + 2(51-n) - 2 = 100 - n \\le 100,$\nit follows that $67| n - 2k + 2$ implies that $n-2k+2 = 67$ itself.\nNow, note that we need $n$ to be odd, and also that $n+2k-2 = 67 \\le 100-n \\Longrightarrow n \\le 33$.\nWe can check that all rows with odd $n$ satisfying $1 \\le n \\le 33$ indeed contains one entry that is a multiple of $67$, and so the answer is $\\frac{33+1}{2} = \\boxed{17}$.", "pred": "We can start by finding the second row of the array. The second row consists of the sum of the two entries diagonally above it in the first row. So, the second row is $4, 8, 12, \\ldots, 196$. \n\nSimilarly, we can find the third row by summing the two entries diagonally above it in the second row. The third row is $12, 20, 28, \\ldots, 392$.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can find the fourth row, fifth row, and so on. \n\nTo find the number of entries in the array that are multiples of $67$, we can look at each row individually. \n\nIn the first row, there are $50$ odd integers. Since $67$ is not an odd integer, there are no multiples of $67$ in the first row.\n\nIn the second row, there are $49$ even integers. Since $67$ is not an even integer, there are no multiples of $67$ in the second row.\n\nIn the third row, there are $48$ integers. We can see that $67$ is not a multiple of any of the integers in the third row. \n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that there are no multiples of $67$ in any row of the array.\n\nTherefore, the answer is $\\boxed{0}$."}

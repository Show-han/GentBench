{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $S_i$ be the set of all integers $n$ such that $100i\\leq n < 100(i + 1)$. For example, $S_4$ is the set ${400,401,402,\\ldots,499}$. How many of the sets $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_{999}$ do not contain a perfect square?\n", "solution": "The difference between consecutive squares is $(x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1$, which means that all squares above $50^2 = 2500$ are more than $100$ apart.\nThen the first $26$ sets ($S_0,\\cdots S_{25}$) each have at least one perfect square. Also, since $316^2 < 100000$ (which is when $i = 1000$), there are $316 - 50 = 266$ other sets after $S_{25}$ that have a perfect square.\nThere are $1000 - 266 - 26 = \\boxed{708}$ sets without a perfect square.", "pred": "To determine whether a set $S_i$ contains a perfect square, we need to find the smallest and largest perfect squares that are within the range of $S_i$. \n\nThe smallest perfect square that is greater than or equal to $100i$ is $(\\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil)^2$. \nThe largest perfect square that is less than $100(i+1)$ is $(\\lfloor \\sqrt{100(i+1)-1} \\rfloor)^2$. \n\nIf $(\\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil)^2 \\leq (\\lfloor \\sqrt{100(i+1)-1} \\rfloor)^2$, then $S_i$ contains a perfect square. Otherwise, $S_i$ does not contain a perfect square. \n\nWe can simplify this inequality by removing the square roots and squaring both sides. \n$(\\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil)^2 \\leq (\\lfloor \\sqrt{100(i+1)-1} \\rfloor)^2$\n$\\lceil \\sqrt{100i} \\rceil^2 \\leq \\lfloor \\sqrt{100(i+1)-1} \\rfloor^2$\n\nNow we can count the number of sets $S_i$ that satisfy this inequality. \n\nFor $i = 0$, the inequality becomes $0 \\leq 0$, which is true.

So $S_7$ contains a perfect square. \n\nFor $i = 8$, the inequality becomes $38 \\leq 73$, which is true. So $S_8$ contains a perfect square. \n\nFor $i = 9$, the inequality becomes $42 \\leq 82$, which is true.

So $S_{10}$ contains a perfect square. \n\nFor $i = 11$, the inequality becomes $50 \\leq 100$, which is true. So $S_{11}$ contains a perfect square. \n\nFor $i = 12$, the inequality becomes $54 \\leq 109$, which is true. So $S_{12}$ contains a perfect square. \n\nFor $i = 13$, the inequality becomes $58 \\leq 118$, which is true.

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$?", "solution": "Let $23a$ be the multiple we seek. Thus $$23a\\equiv 4\\pmod{89}.$$ Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4$, then reducing modulo $89$, gives: \\begin{align*}\n92a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89} \\\\\n3a &\\equiv 16 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} Multiplying both sides by $30$, then reducing again, gives: \\begin{align*}\n90a &\\equiv 480 \\pmod{89} \\\\\na &\\equiv 480-445 = 35 \\pmod{89}\n\\end{align*} All of these steps are reversible, so $35$ is the unique solution $\\pmod{89}$ to the original congruence. The smallest positive solution is $a=35$, giving $23a=\\boxed{805}$. (Indeed, we can check that $805 = 9\\cdot 89 + 4$.)", "pred": "Let's start by finding the first few multiples of $23$ and $89$:\n\nMultiples of $23$: $23, 46, 69, 92, 115, \\ldots$\nMultiples of $89$: $89, 178, 267, 356, 445, \\ldots$\n\nWe can see that the first multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$ is $267$. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of $23$ that is $4$ more than a multiple of $89$ is $\\boxed{267}$."}

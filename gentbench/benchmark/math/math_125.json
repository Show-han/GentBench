{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The number 236! ends in how many zeros when expressed as an integer?", "solution": "To find the number of terminal zeros, we must find the number of products $2\\times5$ in $236!$. Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, we can get our answer by finding the largest power of 5 that divides $236!$.  Every multiple of 5 less than 236 gives a factor of 5, each multiple of 25 gives an additional factor of 5, and each multiple of 125 gives a third factor of 5.  Therefore, the number of factors of 5 in $236!$ is $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{5}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{25}\\right\\rfloor+ \\left\\lfloor\\frac{236}{125}\\right\\rfloor = 47+9+1=57$. The highest power of 5 that divides $236!$ is $5^{57}$ so $236!$ ends in $\\boxed{57}$ zeros.", "pred": "To determine the number of zeros at the end of 236!, we need to find the number of factors of 10 in its prime factorization. Since 10 = 2 * 5, we need to count the number of pairs of 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of 236!. \n\nStep 1: Count the number of factors of 5 in the prime factorization of 236!\n- Divide 236 by 5: 236 \u00f7 5 = 47\n- Divide 47 by 5: 47 \u00f7 5 = 9\n- Divide 9 by 5: 9 \u00f7 5 = 1\n\nStep 2: Count the number of factors of 2 in the prime factorization of 236!\n- Divide 236 by 2: 236 \u00f7 2 = 118\n- Divide 118 by 2: 118 \u00f7 2 = 59\n- Divide 59 by 2: 59 \u00f7 2 = 29\n- Divide 29 by 2: 29 \u00f7 2 = 14\n- Divide 14 by 2: 14 \u00f7 2 = 7\n- Divide 7 by 2: 7 \u00f7 2 = 3\n- Divide 3 by 2: 3 \u00f7 2 = 1\n\nStep 3: Count the number of pairs of 2 and 5\nSince we have 3 factors of 5 and 7 factors of 2, we can only form 3 pairs of 2 and 5.\n\nTherefore, the number 236! ends in 3 zeros when expressed as an integer."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $p$ be the largest prime with 2010 digits. What is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12?", "solution": "Let us iterate over larger and larger positive integers for $k$. If $k=1$, then $p^2-k = p^2-1 = (p+1)(p-1)$. Since $p$ is odd, both $p+1$ and $p-1$ are even, so therefore $p^2-1$ is divisible by 4. Also, since $p$ is not divisible by 3, then $p$ must either be one greater or two greater than a multiple of 3, which means that $p-1$ or $p+1$ is divisible by 3, respectively. As a result, $p^2-1$ is divisible by both 3 and 4, so it is divisible by 12. Therefore, we have $\\boxed{k = 1}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12, we need to consider the possible remainders when $p^2$ is divided by 12.\n\nStep 1: Find the possible remainders when a prime number is divided by 12.\n- When a prime number is divided by 12, the possible remainders are 1, 5, 7, or 11. This is because a prime number greater than 3 cannot be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, or 10.\n\nStep 2: Determine the remainder when $p^2$ is divided by 12.\n- Since $p$ is the largest prime with 2010 digits, we can assume that $p$ ends in 1, 3, 7, or 9. Therefore, the possible remainders when $p^2$ is divided by 12 are 1, 9, 1, or 9, respectively.\n\nStep 3: Find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12.\n- To make $p^2 - k$ divisible by 12, we need to subtract a multiple of 12 from $p^2$.\n- Since the possible remainders when $p^2$ is divided by 12 are 1, 9, 1, or 9, we need to find the smallest multiple of 12 that is greater than or equal to each of these remainders.\n- The smallest multiple of 12 greater than or equal to 1 is 12.\n- The smallest multiple of 12 greater than or equal to 9 is 12.\n- The smallest multiple of 12 greater than or equal to 1 is 12.\n- The smallest multiple of 12 greater than or equal to 9 is 12.\n- Therefore, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $p^2 - k$ is divisible by 12 is 12.\n\nAnswer: The smallest positive integer $k$ is 12."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: One of Euler's conjectures was disproved in the 1960s by three American mathematicians when they showed there was a positive integer such that $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$. Find the value of $n$.\n", "solution": "Note that $n$ is even, since the $LHS$ consists of two odd and two even numbers. By Fermat's Little Theorem, we know ${n^{5}}$ is congruent to $n$ modulo 5. Hence,\n$3 + 0 + 4 + 2 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\n$4 \\equiv n\\pmod{5}$\nContinuing, we examine the equation modulo 3,\n$1 - 1 + 0 + 0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\n$0 \\equiv n\\pmod{3}$\nThus, $n$ is divisible by three and leaves a remainder of four when divided by 5. It's obvious that $n>133$, so the only possibilities are $n = 144$ or $n \\geq 174$. It quickly becomes apparent that 174 is much too large, so $n$ must be $\\boxed{144}$.", "pred": "We can start by simplifying the equation $133^5+110^5+84^5+27^5=n^{5}$. \n\nNext, we can calculate the values of $133^5$, $110^5$, $84^5$, and $27^5$ using a calculator or computer program. \n\nThen, we can add these values together to find the sum on the left side of the equation. \n\nFinally, we can take the fifth root of this sum to find the value of $n$."}

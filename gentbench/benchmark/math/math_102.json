{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal?", "solution": "If $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is a terminating decimal, then $n+101$ is divisible only by 2 and 5. We proceed by looking for integers only divisible by 2 and 5.\n\nWe find that 125 is the smallest power of 5 greater than 101. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 25 is also 125; multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 100, then 200. The smallest satisfactory integer divisible by 5 is also 125, since multiplying by powers of 2 gives us 80, then 160. Finally, the smallest power of 2 greater than 101 is 128. 125 is the smallest denominator that will give a terminating decimal, so we have that $n+101 = 125$ which implies $n = \\boxed{24}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+101}$ is equal to a terminating decimal, we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that the denominator $n+101$ is divisible only by powers of 2 and/or powers of 5.\n\nStep 1: Start with the smallest power of 2, which is $2^0 = 1$. Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 1. Since any number is divisible by 1, we move on to the next step.\n\nStep 2: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 2. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 2.\n\nStep 3: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 4. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 3.\n\nStep 4: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 8. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 4.\n\nStep 5: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 16. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 5.\n\nStep 6: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 32. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 6.\n\nStep 7: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 5. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 7.\n\nStep 8: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 10. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 8.\n\nStep 9: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 20. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 9.\n\nStep 10: Check if $n+101$ is divisible by 40. If it is, move on to the next step. If not, increment $n$ by 1 and repeat step 10.\n\nContinue this process, checking for divisibility by higher powers of 2 and 5, until we find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $n+101$ is divisible only by powers of 2 and/or powers of 5."}

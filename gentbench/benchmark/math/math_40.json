{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. What is the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base?  Give your response in base 2.", "solution": "The smallest possible 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is $10001_2$, which is $2^4+2^0=17_{10}$. Now we try converting 17 to other bases. In base 3, we get $122_3$, and in base 4, we get $101_4$, which is a palindrome. So $\\boxed{10001_2}$ works.", "pred": "To find the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Start by finding the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2. The smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 is 10001.\n\n2. Convert this number to base 10 to determine its value. 10001 in base 2 is equal to 17 in base 10.\n\n3. Find the smallest base in which 17 is a 3-digit palindrome. The smallest base in which 17 is a 3-digit palindrome is base 16.\n\n4. Convert 17 from base 10 to base 16. 17 in base 10 is equal to 11 in base 16.\n\n5. Finally, convert 11 from base 16 back to base 2. 11 in base 16 is equal to 1011 in base 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest 5-digit palindrome in base 2 that can be expressed as a 3-digit palindrome in a different base is 1011 in base 2."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the least positive integer which when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4, when divided by 6 gives a remainder of 5, when divided by 7 gives a remainder of 6, when divided by 8 gives a remainder of 7, when divided by 9 gives a remainder of 8, and when divided by 10 gives a remainder of 9?", "solution": "Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer satisfying all the given conditions. Note that since $N$ gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5, $N+1$ must be divisible by 5. Similarly, $N+1$ is also divisible by 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus the least possible value for $N+1$ is the least common multiple of 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Prime factorizing these numbers, we find that their least common multiple is $2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 7 = 2520$. Thus the least possible value for $N$ is $\\boxed{2519}$.", "pred": "To find the least positive integer that satisfies all these conditions, we can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the divisors (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). \n\nThe LCM of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 is 840. \n\nNow, we need to find the number that gives the specified remainders when divided by each of these divisors. \n\nTo do this, we can add the respective remainders to the LCM. \n\n840 + 4 = 844 (remainder when divided by 5)\n840 + 5 = 845 (remainder when divided by 6)\n840 + 6 = 846 (remainder when divided by 7)\n840 + 7 = 847 (remainder when divided by 8)\n840 + 8 = 848 (remainder when divided by 9)\n840 + 9 = 849 (remainder when divided by 10)\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer that satisfies all the given conditions is 849."}

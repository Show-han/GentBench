{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If the least common multiple of two 6-digit integers has 10 digits, then their greatest common divisor has at most how many digits?", "solution": "Call the two integers $a$ and $b$. Recall that the product of two numbers' LCM and GCD is equal to the product of the two numbers themselves: $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\cdot \\gcd(a,b) = ab.$$This can be rearranged to give $$\\gcd(a,b) = \\frac{ab}{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]}.$$In this case, we know that $a<10^6$ and $b<10^6$, so $ab<10^{12}$. We also know that $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]\\ge 10^9$, since the smallest 10-digit number is $10^9$.\n\nTherefore, $$\\gcd(a,b) < \\frac{10^{12}}{10^9} = 10^3,$$so $\\gcd(a,b)$ has at most $\\boxed{3}$ digits.\n\n(We should check that there are actual integers $a$ and $b$ for which $\\gcd(a,b)$ has $3$ digits. There are; for example, we can take $a=500{,}000$ and $b=200{,}100$, in which case the least common multiple is $1{,}000{,}500{,}000$ and the greatest common divisor is $100$.)", "pred": "Step 1: Let's assume the two 6-digit integers are A and B.\n\nStep 2: The least common multiple (LCM) of A and B is a number that is divisible by both A and B, and it is the smallest number that has this property.\n\nStep 3: If the LCM of A and B has 10 digits, it means that it is a 10-digit number.\n\nStep 4: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B is the largest number that divides both A and B without leaving a remainder.\n\nStep 5: The GCD of A and B cannot have more digits than the smallest number among A and B.\n\nStep 6: Since A and B are both 6-digit integers, their GCD can have at most 6 digits.\n\nAnswer: The greatest common divisor has at most 6 digits."}

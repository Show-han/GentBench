{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find $3x^2 y^2$ if $x$ and $y$ are integers such that $y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517$.\n", "solution": "If we move the $x^2$ term to the left side, it is factorable:\n\\[(3x^2 + 1)(y^2 - 10) = 517 - 10\\]\n$507$ is equal to $3 \\cdot 13^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $3x^2 + 1$ cannot equal a multiple of three. $169$ doesn't work either, so $3x^2 + 1 = 13$, and $x^2 = 4$. This leaves $y^2 - 10 = 39$, so $y^2 = 49$. Thus, $3x^2 y^2 = 3 \\times 4 \\times 49 = \\boxed{588}$.", "pred": "First, we can factor out $y^2$ from both terms on the left side of the equation: $y^2(1 + 3x^2) = 30x^2 + 517$.\n\nNext, we can subtract $30x^2$ from both sides: $y^2(1 + 3x^2) - 30x^2 = 517$.\n\nSimplifying the left side, we have $y^2 + 3x^2y^2 - 30x^2 = 517$.\n\nCombining like terms, we get $4x^2y^2 - 30x^2 = 517$.\n\nNow, we can factor out $2x^2$ from both terms on the left side: $2x^2(2y^2 - 15) = 517$.\n\nSince $517$ is a prime number, the only way to factor it is $1 \\times 517$ or $(-1) \\times (-517)$. Therefore, $2y^2 - 15$ must equal either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nIf $2y^2 - 15 = 1$, then $2y^2 = 16$ and $y^2 = 8$. However, $8$ is not a perfect square, so this case is not possible.\n\nIf $2y^2 - 15 = -1$, then $2y^2 = 14$ and $y^2 = 7$. Since $7$ is a perfect square, we can substitute this value back into the equation to solve for $x$.\n\n$4x^2(7) - 30x^2 = 517$\n\n$28x^2 - 30x^2 = 517$\n\n$-2x^2 = 517$\n\nThis equation has no integer solutions for $x$, so there is no solution for $3x^2y^2$."}

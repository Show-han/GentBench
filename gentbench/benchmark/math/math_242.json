{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the largest possible value of $k$ for which $3^{11}$ is expressible as the sum of $k$ consecutive positive integers.\n", "solution": "Let us write down one such sum, with $m$ terms and first term $n + 1$:\n$3^{11} = (n + 1) + (n + 2) + \\ldots + (n + m) = \\frac{1}{2} m(2n + m + 1)$.\nThus $m(2n + m + 1) = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}$ so $m$ is a divisor of $2\\cdot 3^{11}$. However, because $n \\geq 0$ we have $m^2 < m(m + 1) \\leq 2\\cdot 3^{11}$ so $m < \\sqrt{2\\cdot 3^{11}} < 3^6$. Thus, we are looking for large factors of $2\\cdot 3^{11}$ which are less than $3^6$. The largest such factor is clearly $2\\cdot 3^5 = 486$; for this value of $m$ we do indeed have the valid expression $3^{11} = 122 + 123 + \\ldots + 607$, for which $k=\\boxed{486}$.", "pred": "Let's call the first number in the sequence $n$. Then the sum of the $k$ consecutive positive integers is $kn + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2}$. We want this to be equal to $3^{11}$. \n\nSo we have the equation $kn + \\frac{k(k-1)}{2} = 3^{11}$. \n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $2kn + k^2 - k = 2 \\cdot 3^{11}$. \n\nRearranging, we get $k^2 + (2n-1)k - 2 \\cdot 3^{11} = 0$. \n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $k$, and we want to find the largest possible value of $k$. \n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $(2n-1)^2 + 8 \\cdot 3^{11}$. \n\nFor the quadratic to have real solutions, the discriminant must be nonnegative. \n\nSo we have $(2n-1)^2 + 8 \\cdot 3^{11} \\geq 0$. \n\nSimplifying, we get $(2n-1)^2 \\geq -8 \\cdot 3^{11}$. \n\nSince $(2n-1)^2$ is always nonnegative, the largest possible value of $k$ is $\\boxed{3^{11}}$."}

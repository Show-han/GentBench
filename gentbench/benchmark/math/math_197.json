{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $S$ be the set of integers between $1$ and $2^{40}$ whose binary expansions have exactly two $1$'s. If a number is chosen at random from $S,$ the probability that it is divisible by $9$ is $p/q,$ where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q.$\n", "solution": "A positive integer $n$ has exactly two 1s in its binary representation exactly when $n = 2^j + 2^k$ for $j \\neq k$ nonnegative integers. Thus, the set $S$ is equal to the set $\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\mid n = 2^j + 2^k \\,\\mathrm{ and }\\, 0 \\leq j < k \\leq 39\\}$. (The second condition ensures simultaneously that $j \\neq k$ and that each such number less than $2^{40}$ is counted exactly once.) This means there are ${40 \\choose 2} = 780$ total such numbers.\nNow, consider the powers of $2$ mod $9$: $2^{6n} \\equiv 1, 2^{6n + 1} \\equiv 2, 2^{6n + 2} \\equiv 4, 2^{6n + 3} \\equiv 8 \\equiv -1,$ $2^{6n + 4} \\equiv 7 \\equiv -2,$ $2^{6n + 5} \\equiv 5 \\equiv -4 \\pmod 9$.\nIt's clear what the pairs $j, k$ can look like. If one is of the form $6n$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 3$ (7 choices). If one is of the form $6n + 1$ (7 choices) the other must be of the form $6n + 4$ (6 choices). And if one is of the form $6n + 2$ (7 choices), the other must be of the form $6n + 5$ (6 choices). This means that there are $7\\cdot 7 + 7\\cdot 6 + 7\\cdot 6 = 49 + 42 +42 = 133$ total \"good\" numbers.\nThe probability is $\\frac{133}{780}$, and the answer is $133 + 780 = \\boxed{913}$.", "pred": "To find the probability that a number chosen at random from $S$ is divisible by $9,$ we need to find the number of elements in $S$ that are divisible by $9,$ and divide it by the total number of elements in $S.$\n\nFirst, we count the number of elements in $S.$ Since each element in $S$ has exactly two $1$'s in its binary expansion, we can choose the positions of the $1$'s in $\\binom{40}{2}$ ways. However, we must subtract the number of elements in $S$ that have a leading zero, since leading zeros are not allowed in binary representations. There are $\\binom{39}{1}$ ways to choose the positions of the $1$'s if the leading digit is zero. Therefore, the total number of elements in $S$ is $\\binom{40}{2} - \\binom{39}{1} = 780.$\n\nNext, we count the number of elements in $S$ that are divisible by $9.$ A number is divisible by $9$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ Since each element in $S$ has exactly two $1$'s in its binary expansion, the sum of its digits is equal to $2.$ Therefore, we need to find the number of ways to choose two positions for the $1$'s in $\\binom{40}{2}$ ways, and divide it by the total number of elements in $S.$ There are $\\binom{40}{2}$ ways to choose the positions of the $1$'s, so the probability that a number chosen at random from $S$ is divisible by $9$ is $\\frac{\\binom{40}{2}}{780} = \\frac{40 \\cdot 39}{2 \\cdot 780} = \\frac{13}{65}.$\n\nFinally, $p+q = 13+65 = \\boxed{78}.$"}

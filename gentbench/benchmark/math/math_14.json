{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Express $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{02}+0.\\overline{003}$  as a common fraction.", "solution": "We write each repeating decimal as a fraction. We convert $0.\\overline{1}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\\overline{1}=x$. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get $10x =1.\\overline{1}$. We subtract those two equations to get \\begin{align*}\n10 x -x&=1.\\overline{1}-0.\\overline{1} \\quad \\implies \\\\\n9 x&=1 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nx &= \\frac19.\n\\end{align*}Next, we convert $0.\\overline{02}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\\overline{02}=y$. Multiplying by 100, we get $100 y =2.\\overline{02}$. We subtract those two equations to get: \\begin{align*}\n100 y - y &=2.\\overline{02}-0.\\overline{02} \\quad \\implies \\\\\n99 y &=2 \\quad \\implies \\\\\ny &= \\frac{2}{99}.\n\\end{align*}Finally, we convert $0.\\overline{003}$ to a fraction by setting $0.\\overline{003}=z$. Multiplying by 1000, we get $1000z =3.\\overline{003}$. We subtract those two numbers to get: \\begin{align*}\n1000 z -z &=3.\\overline{003}-0.\\overline{003} \\quad \\implies \\\\\n999 z &=3 \\quad \\implies \\\\\nz &= \\frac{3}{999}.\n\\end{align*}The requested sum is $\\frac19+\\frac{2}{99}+\\frac{3}{999}=\\boxed{\\frac{164}{1221}}$.", "pred": "To express $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{02}+0.\\overline{003}$ as a common fraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Let's start by converting each repeating decimal to a fraction. \n\n$0.\\overline{1} = \\frac{1}{9}$ (since the repeating digit is 1 and there is only one digit repeating)\n$0.\\overline{02} = \\frac{2}{99}$ (since the repeating digit is 2 and there are two digits repeating)\n$0.\\overline{003} = \\frac{3}{999}$ (since the repeating digit is 3 and there are three digits repeating)\n\n2. Now, we can add the fractions together.\n\n$\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{2}{99} + \\frac{3}{999}$\n\n3. To add the fractions, we need to find a common denominator. In this case, the least common multiple of 9, 99, and 999 is 999.\n\n4. We can rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 999.\n\n$\\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{111}{999}$\n$\\frac{2}{99} = \\frac{22}{999}$\n$\\frac{3}{999} = \\frac{3}{999}$\n\n5. Now, we can add the fractions together.\n\n$\\frac{111}{999} + \\frac{22}{999} + \\frac{3}{999} = \\frac{111 + 22 + 3}{999} = \\frac{136}{999}$\n\nTherefore, $0.\\overline{1}+0.\\overline{02}+0.\\overline{003}$ expressed as a common fraction is $\\frac{136}{999}$."}

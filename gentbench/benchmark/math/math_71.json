{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The number $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ is divisible by $72.$ If $G$ and $H$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all distinct possible values of the product $GH?$ (Count each possible value of $GH$ only once, even if it results from multiple $G,$ $H$ pairs.)", "solution": "For $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by $8$ and by $9.$ It is easier to check for divisibility by $8$ first, since this will allow us to determine a small number of possibilities for $H.$\n\nFor $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ to be divisible by $8,$ we must have $2H6$ divisible by $8.$ Going through the possibilities as in part (a), we can find that $2H6$ is divisible by $8$ when $H=1,5,9$ (that is, $216,$ $256,$ and $296$ are divisible by $8$ while $206,$ $226,$ $236,$ $246,$ $266,$ $276,$ $286$ are not divisible by $8$).\n\nWe must now use each possible value of $H$ to find the possible values of $G$ that make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,2H6$ divisible by $9.$\n\nFirst, $H=1.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,216$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+1+6=31+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we see that $31+G$ is between $31$ and $40,$ so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=5.$\n\nNext, $H=5.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,256$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+5+6=35+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we know that $35+G$ is between $35$ and $44,$ and so must be equal to $36$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=1.$\n\nLast, $H=9.$ What value(s) of $G$ make $5\\,41G\\,507\\,296$ divisible by $9?$ In this case, we need $$5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+9+6=39+G$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $G$ is between $0$ and $9,$ we have $39+G$ between $39$ and $48,$ and so must be equal to $45$ if it is divisible by $9.$ Thus, $G=6.$\n\nTherefore, the possible pairs of values are $H=1$ and $G=5,$ $H=5$ and $G=1,$ and $H=9$ and $G=6.$ This gives two possible distinct values for the product $GH:$ $5$ and $54,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{59}.$", "pred": "For a number to be divisible by $72,$ it must be divisible by both $8$ and $9.$\n\nFor a number to be divisible by $8,$ the last three digits must be divisible by $8.$ Therefore, $H6$ must be divisible by $8.$ The only two-digit numbers that are divisible by $8$ are $16,$ $24,$ $32,$ $40,$ $48,$ $56,$ $64,$ and $72.$ Therefore, $H6$ must be one of these numbers.\n\nFor a number to be divisible by $9,$ the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9.$ Therefore, $5+4+1+G+5+0+7+2+H+6$ must be divisible by $9.$ Simplifying, we have $30+G+H.$ Therefore, $G+H$ must be divisible by $9.$ The possible values for $G+H$ are $2+4=6,$ $3+2=5,$ $4+0=4,$ $5+6=11,$ $6+4=10,$ and $7+2=9.$\n\nWe can now make a chart of all possible values for $G$ and $H:$\n\\[\\begin{array}{c|c|c} & & \\\\ [-2ex] \\boldsymbol{H6} & \\boldsymbol{G+H} & \\boldsymbol{GH} \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline & & \\\\ [-2ex] 16 & 6 & 6 \\\\ 24 & 5 & 4 \\\\ 32 & 4 & 2 \\\\ 40 & 11 & 0 \\\\ 48 & 10 & 8 \\\\ 56 & 9 & 5 \\\\ 64 & 6 & 4 \\\\ 72 & 5 & 2 \\\\ \\end{array}\\]The sum of all distinct possible values of $GH$ is $6+4+2+0+8+5=\\boxed{25}.$"}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A point whose coordinates are both integers is called a lattice point. How many lattice points lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$?\n", "solution": "\\[(x-y)(x+y)=2000^2=2^8 \\cdot 5^6\\]\nNote that $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ have the same parities, so both must be even. We first give a factor of $2$ to both $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$. We have $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ left. Since there are $7 \\cdot 7=49$ factors of $2^6 \\cdot 5^6$, and since both $x$ and $y$ can be negative, this gives us $49\\cdot2=\\boxed{98}$ lattice points.", "pred": "To find the lattice points on the hyperbola, we can start by considering the equation $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$. \n\nStep 1: We can rewrite the equation as $(x+y)(x-y) = 2000^2$. \n\nStep 2: Since $2000^2$ is a large number, we can start by finding the prime factorization of $2000^2$. \n\nStep 3: The prime factorization of $2000^2$ is $2^8 \\cdot 5^8$. \n\nStep 4: Now, we need to find the possible combinations of factors $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$ that multiply to $2^8 \\cdot 5^8$. \n\nStep 5: Since both $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$ are integers, we can consider all the possible combinations of factors of $2^8 \\cdot 5^8$ that can be expressed as $(x+y)$ and $(x-y)$. \n\nStep 6: For each combination, we can solve the system of equations $(x+y) = a$ and $(x-y) = b$ to find the values of $x$ and $y$. \n\nStep 7: If the values of $x$ and $y$ are both integers, then we have found a lattice point on the hyperbola. \n\nStep 8: Repeat steps 6 and 7 for all possible combinations of factors. \n\nStep 9: Count the number of lattice points found. \n\nNote: This process can be time-consuming and may require the use of a computer program or calculator to find all the lattice points."}

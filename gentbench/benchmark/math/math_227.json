{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: In a parlor game, the magician asks one of the participants to think of a three digit number $(abc)$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ represent digits in base $10$ in the order indicated. The magician then asks this person to form the numbers $(acb)$, $(bca)$, $(bac)$, $(cab)$, and $(cba)$, to add these five numbers, and to reveal their sum, $N$. If told the value of $N$, the magician can identify the original number, $(abc)$. Play the role of the magician and determine $(abc)$ if $N= 3194$.\n", "solution": "Let $m$ be the number $100a+10b+c$. Observe that $3194+m=222(a+b+c)$ so\n\\[m\\equiv -3194\\equiv -86\\equiv 136\\pmod{222}\\]\nThis reduces $m$ to one of $136, 358, 580, 802$. But also $a+b+c=\\frac{3194+m}{222}>\\frac{3194}{222}>14$ so $a+b+c\\geq 15$. Of the four options, only $m = \\boxed{358}$ satisfies this inequality.", "pred": "Let's call the original number $(abc)$. \n\nTo find $(acb)$, we swap the second and third digits, so $(acb) = 100a + 10c + b$.\nTo find $(bca)$, we swap the first and second digits, so $(bca) = 100b + 10c + a$.\nTo find $(bac)$, we swap the first and third digits, so $(bac) = 100b + 10a + c$.\nTo find $(cab)$, we swap the second and third digits, so $(cab) = 100c + 10a + b$.\nTo find $(cba)$, we swap all three digits, so $(cba) = 100c + 10b + a$.\n\nAdding these five numbers together, we get $N = (abc) + (acb) + (bca) + (bac) + (cab) + (cba) = 222(a + b + c)$.\n\nSince we know that $N = 3194$, we can solve for $(a + b + c)$ by dividing $3194$ by $222$. We find that $(a + b + c) = 14$.\n\nNow, we need to find a three-digit number $(abc)$ where the sum of its digits is $14$. The only possible combination is $a = 5$, $b = 4$, and $c = 5$. \n\nTherefore, $(abc) = \\boxed{545}$."}

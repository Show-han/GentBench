{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If we let $f(n)$ denote the sum of all the positive divisors of the integer $n$, how many integers $i$ exist such that $1 \\le i \\le 2010$ and $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$?", "solution": "Note firstly that $f(i)$ must be an integer, so this means that $i$ must be a perfect square in order for $\\sqrt{i}$ to be an integer. Out of the perfect squares, we claim that $i$ must be the square of some prime $p$. For if $\\sqrt{i}$ is composite, then it can be written as the product of two integers $a$ and $b$ and we find $f(i) \\ge 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i + a + b > 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$. Moreover, if $\\sqrt{i}$ is prime, then the only factors of $i$ are 1, $\\sqrt{i}$, and $i$, so $f(i) = 1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ as desired. It follows that we only need to calculate the number of primes less than $\\sqrt{2010}$. Since $\\sqrt{2010} < 45$, the desired set of primes is $\\{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43\\}$. The set has $\\boxed{14}$ elements.", "pred": "First, we note that $f(i)$ is always an integer, since the sum of divisors of any positive integer is always an integer. Therefore, $1 + \\sqrt{i} + i$ must also be an integer. \n\nLet $k = \\sqrt{i}$. Then, we have $f(i) = 1 + k + k^2$. We want to find the number of integers $k$ such that $1 + k + k^2$ is an integer. \n\nSince $1 + k + k^2$ is an integer, we know that $k$ must be an integer or half-integer. \n\nIf $k$ is an integer, then $1 + k + k^2$ is an integer if and only if $k$ is an integer divisor of $1$. The only integer divisor of $1$ is $1$, so $k = 1$ is the only solution in this case. \n\nIf $k$ is a half-integer, then $1 + k + k^2$ is an integer if and only if $k$ is a half-integer divisor of $1$. The only half-integer divisor of $1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so $k = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the only solution in this case. \n\nTherefore, the only possible values of $k$ are $1$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$. \n\nSince $k = \\sqrt{i}$, the only possible values of $i$ are $1^2 = 1$ and $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$. \n\nHowever, we are given that $1 \\le i \\le 2010$, so the only possible value of $i$ is $1$. \n\nTherefore, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ integer $i$ that satisfies the given condition."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $a_n=6^{n}+8^{n}$. Determine the remainder upon dividing $a_ {83}$ by $49$.\n", "solution": "Since $\\phi(49) = 42$ (see Euler's totient function), Euler's Totient Theorem tells us that $a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{49}$ where $\\text{gcd}(a,49) = 1$. Thus $6^{83} + 8^{83} \\equiv 6^{2(42)-1}+8^{2(42)-1}$ $\\equiv 6^{-1} + 8^{-1} \\equiv \\frac{8+6}{48}$ $\\equiv \\frac{14}{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{35} \\pmod{49}$.", "pred": "We can rewrite $a_n$ as $(7-1)^n+(7+1)^n$. By the Binomial Theorem, all terms in the expansion of $(7-1)^n$ except the last two will be divisible by $49$. Similarly, all terms in the expansion of $(7+1)^n$ except the first two will be divisible by $49$. Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $a_n$ by $49$ is the sum of the last two terms of $(7-1)^n$ plus the first two terms of $(7+1)^n$. \n\nFor $n=83$, the last two terms of $(7-1)^n$ are $\\binom{83}{82}7^{82}(-1)^1=-83\\cdot7^{82}$, and the first two terms of $(7+1)^n$ are $\\binom{83}{0}7^0(1)^{83}+\\binom{83}{1}7^1(1)^{82}=1\\cdot1\\cdot1+83\\cdot7=1+581=582$. Therefore, the remainder upon dividing $a_{83}$ by $49$ is $(-83\\cdot7^{82})+582$. \n\nTo find this remainder, we can use the fact that $7^2\\equiv-1\\pmod{49}$. Since $82$ is even, we have $7^{82}\\equiv(7^2)^{41}\\equiv(-1)^{41}\\equiv-1\\pmod{49}$. Therefore, $-83\\cdot7^{82}\\equiv-83\\cdot(-1)\\equiv83\\pmod{49}$. \n\nFinally, we have $83+582=665$, and $665\\equiv\\boxed{28}\\pmod{49}$."}

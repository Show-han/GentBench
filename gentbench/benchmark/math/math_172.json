{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: \"Modulo $m$ graph paper\" consists of a grid of $m^2$ points, representing all pairs of integer residues $(x,y)$ where $0\\le x<m$. To graph a congruence on modulo $m$ graph paper, we mark every point $(x,y)$ that satisfies the congruence. For example, a graph of $y\\equiv x^2\\pmod 5$ would consist of the points $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,4)$, $(3,4)$, and $(4,1)$.\n\nThe graphs of $$y\\equiv 5x+2\\pmod{16}$$and $$y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$$on modulo $16$ graph paper have some points in common. What is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of those points?", "solution": "We are looking for pairs $(x,y)$ that satisfy both $y\\equiv 5x+2$ and $y\\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}$. Thus, the $x$-coordinates in all such pairs satisfy $$5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12\\pmod{16}.$$Subtracting $5x+2$ from both sides of this congruence, we have $$0 \\equiv 6x+10\\pmod{16},$$which is equivalent to $$0 \\equiv 6x-6\\pmod{16}$$(since $10\\equiv -6\\pmod{16}$).\n\nThus the solutions we seek are values $x$ in the range $0\\le x<16$ such that $16$ divides $6(x-1)$. The solutions are $x=1,$ $x=9,$ so the sum of $x$-coordinates is $1+9=\\boxed{10}$.\n\n(As a check, note that the pairs $(1,7)$ and $(9,15)$ satisfy both of the original congruences, so these are the points shared by the two graphs.)", "pred": "To find the points that satisfy both congruences, we can set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$. \n\nSetting $5x+2 \\equiv 11x+12 \\pmod{16}$, we can subtract $5x$ and $11x$ from both sides to get $2 \\equiv 6x+12 \\pmod{16}$. \n\nSubtracting $12$ from both sides gives $-10 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}$. \n\nTo simplify this further, we can add $16$ to both sides to get $6 \\equiv 6x \\pmod{16}$. \n\nDividing both sides by $6$, we find that $1 \\equiv x \\pmod{16}$. \n\nTherefore, the $x$-coordinates of the points that satisfy both congruences are $1, 17, 33, \\ldots$. \n\nThe sum of these $x$-coordinates can be found by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. \n\nThe first term is $1$, the common difference is $16$, and the number of terms is $\\frac{16^2}{16} = 16$. \n\nUsing the formula, the sum is $\\frac{16}{2}(1+16) = \\frac{16}{2}(17) = 8(17) = \\boxed{136}$."}

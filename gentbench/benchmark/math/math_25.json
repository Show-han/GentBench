{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: When the base-16 number $66666_{16}$ is written in base 2, how many base-2 digits (bits) does it have?", "solution": "We have \\begin{align*}\n66666_{16} &= 6\\cdot 16^4 + 6\\cdot 16^3 + 6\\cdot 16^2 + 6\\cdot 16 + 6 \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (16^4+16^3+16^2+16+1) \\\\\n&= 6\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= (2^2+2)\\cdot (2^{16}+2^{12}+2^8+2^4+1) \\\\\n&= 2^{18}+2^{17}+2^{14}+2^{13}+2^{10}+2^9+2^6+2^5+2^2+2.\n\\end{align*}Actually, this is more detail than necessary; what is important is that $2^{18} \\le 66666_{16} < 2^{19}$, which tells us that the base-2 expression of this number has $\\boxed{19}$ digits or bits (with place values $2^{18},2^{17},2^{16},\\ldots,2^2,2^1,2^0$).", "pred": "To convert a base-16 number to base 2, we need to convert each base-16 digit to its equivalent base-2 representation. \n\nThe base-16 number $66666_{16}$ has 5 digits. \n\nTo convert each digit to base 2, we can use the following conversions:\n\n$6_{16} = 110_2$\n$6_{16} = 110_2$\n$6_{16} = 110_2$\n$6_{16} = 110_2$\n$6_{16} = 110_2$\n\nTherefore, each base-16 digit requires 3 base-2 digits. \n\nSince the number has 5 digits, the total number of base-2 digits (bits) is $5 \\times 3 = 15$. \n\nSo, the base-16 number $66666_{16}$ written in base 2 has 15 base-2 digits (bits)."}

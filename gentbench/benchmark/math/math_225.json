{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors?\n", "solution": "We use the fact that the number of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}$ is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\cdots (e_k + 1)$. If a number has $18 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3$ factors, then it can have at most $3$ distinct primes in its factorization.\nDividing the greatest power of $2$ from $n$, we have an odd integer with six positive divisors, which indicates that it either is ($6 = 2 \\cdot 3$) a prime raised to the $5$th power, or two primes, one of which is squared. The smallest example of the former is $3^5 = 243$, while the smallest example of the latter is $3^2 \\cdot 5 = 45$.\nSuppose we now divide all of the odd factors from $n$; then we require a power of $2$ with $\\frac{18}{6} = 3$ factors, namely $2^{3-1} = 4$. Thus, our answer is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{180}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors, we need to consider the prime factorization of the number.\n\nStep 1: Start with the prime factorization of the number. Since we need six odd divisors, the number must have at least three distinct odd prime factors.\n\nStep 2: To have twelve even divisors, the number must have at least four distinct even prime factors.\n\nStep 3: The smallest odd prime number is 3, and the smallest even prime number is 2. Therefore, we can start with the prime factorization of the number as 2^a * 3^b * p * q * r * s, where a, b, p, q, r, and s are positive integers.\n\nStep 4: To have six odd divisors, we need to have (b+1)(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)(s+1) = 6. The only way to achieve this is by having b = 2 and the other exponents equal to 0.\n\nStep 5: To have twelve even divisors, we need to have (a+1)(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)(s+1) = 12. The only way to achieve this is by having a = 3 and the other exponents equal to 0.\n\nStep 6: Putting it all together, the smallest positive integer with six positive odd integer divisors and twelve positive even integer divisors is 2^3 * 3^2 = 72."}

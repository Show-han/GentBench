{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is that largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$?\n", "solution": "If $n+10 \\mid n^3+100$, $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)=n+10$. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we have $\\gcd(n^3+100,n+10)= \\gcd(-10n^2+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(100n+100,n+10)$ $= \\gcd(-900,n+10)$, so $n+10$ must divide $900$. The greatest integer $n$ for which $n+10$ divides $900$ is $\\boxed{890}$; we can double-check manually and we find that indeed $900\\mid 890^3+100$.", "pred": "We can use the Remainder Theorem to solve this problem. The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x-a$, the remainder is $f(a)$. In this case, we want to find the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$. \n\nUsing the Remainder Theorem, we can set up the equation $n^3+100 = 0 \\pmod{n+10}$. This means that the remainder when $n^3+100$ is divided by $n+10$ is $0$. \n\nTo find the largest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this equation, we can use synthetic division. We divide $n^3+100$ by $n+10$ and set the remainder equal to $0$. \n\nThe synthetic division gives us:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n-10 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 100 \\\\\n\\hline\n& & -10 & 100 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nSince the remainder is $0$, we have $-10 \\cdot -10 + 100 = 0$. Therefore, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3+100$ is divisible by $n+10$ is $\\boxed{10}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many positive integer divisors of $2004^{2004}$ are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers?\n", "solution": "The prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167$. Thus the prime factorization of $2004^{2004}$ is $2^{4008}\\cdot 3^{2004}\\cdot 167^{2004}$.\nWe can count the number of divisors of a number by multiplying together one more than each of the exponents of the prime factors in its prime factorization. For example, the number of divisors of $2004=2^2\\cdot 3^1\\cdot 167^1$ is $(2+1)(1+1)(1+1)=12$.\nA positive integer divisor of $2004^{2004}$ will be of the form $2^a\\cdot 3^b\\cdot 167^c$. Thus we need to find how many $(a,b,c)$ satisfy\n$(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)=2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 167.$\nWe can think of this as partitioning the exponents to $a+1,$ $b+1,$ and $c+1$. So let's partition the 2's first. There are two 2's so this is equivalent to partitioning two items in three containers. We can do this in ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways. We can partition the 3 in three ways and likewise we can partition the 167 in three ways. So we have $6\\cdot 3\\cdot 3 = \\boxed{54}$ as our answer.", "pred": "First, we prime factorize $2004 = 2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$. Then, we can find the prime factorization of $2004^{2004}$ by multiplying the exponents by 2004: $2004^{2004} = 2^{4008} \\cdot 3^{2004} \\cdot 167^{2004}$. \n\nTo find the number of positive integer divisors of $2004^{2004}$ that are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors. \n\nFor a divisor to be divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers, the exponents of the prime factors must be multiples of 2004. \n\nSince $2^{4008}$ is already a multiple of 2004, we don't need to consider the exponent of 2 any further. \n\nFor the exponent of 3, we need to find the number of positive integer divisors of 2004 that are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers. The prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$, so the exponent of 3 can be 0, 3, 6, 9, ..., up to 2004. This gives us a total of $\\frac{2004}{3} + 1 = 669$ possible exponents of 3. \n\nSimilarly, for the exponent of 167, we need to find the number of positive integer divisors of 2004 that are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers. The prime factorization of 2004 is $2^2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 167$, so the exponent of 167 can be 0, 3, 6, 9, ..., up to 2004. This gives us a total of $\\frac{2004}{3} + 1 = 669$ possible exponents of 167. \n\nTherefore, the number of positive integer divisors of $2004^{2004}$ that are divisible by exactly 2004 positive integers is $1 \\cdot 669 \\cdot 669 = \\boxed{447561}$."}

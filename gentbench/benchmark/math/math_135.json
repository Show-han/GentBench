{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the sum of the different prime factors of $150280?$", "solution": "Let's find the prime factorization of $150,280$:\n\\begin{align*}\n150{,}280 &= 2^3\\cdot18{,}785 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot3757 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot289 \\\\\n&= 2^3\\cdot5\\cdot13\\cdot17^2.\n\\end{align*}Thus the sum of the different prime factors of 150,280 is $2+5+13+17=\\boxed{37}$.", "pred": "To find the sum of the different prime factors of $150280,$ we first need to find the prime factorization of $150280.$\n\nWe start by dividing $150280$ by $2,$ which gives us $75140.$ Since $2$ is a prime number, we know that $2$ is a prime factor of $150280.$\n\nNext, we divide $75140$ by $2$ again, which gives us $37570.$ Again, we know that $2$ is a prime factor of $37570.$\n\nContinuing in this way, we divide $37570$ by $2$ to get $18785,$ and we divide $18785$ by $5$ to get $3757.$\n\nFinally, we divide $3757$ by $13$ to get $289.$\n\nSince $289$ is a perfect square, we can stop here. The prime factorization of $150280$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 13^2.$\n\nThe different prime factors of $150280$ are $2,$ $5,$ and $13.$\n\nThe sum of these prime factors is $2 + 5 + 13 = \\boxed{20}.$"}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For each positive integer $n$, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the digits of $n$.  For how many values of $n$ is $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2007$?", "solution": "If $n\\leq 2007$, then $S(n)\\leq S(1999)=28$. If $n\\leq\n28$, then $S(n)\\leq S(28)=10$. Therefore if $n$ satisfies the required condition it must also satisfy \\[\nn\\geq 2007-28-10=1969.\n\\] In addition, $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ all leave the same remainder when divided by 9. Because 2007 is a multiple of 9, it follows that $n,S(n),\\text{ and }S(S(n))$ must all be multiples of 3. The required condition is satisfied by $\\boxed{4}$ multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007, namely 1977, 1980, 1983, and 2001.\n\nNote: There appear to be many cases to check, that is, all the multiples of 3 between 1969 and 2007. However, for $1987\\leq n\\leq 1999$, we have $n+S(n)\\geq 1990+19=2009$, so these numbers are eliminated. Thus we need only check 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 2001, and 2004.", "pred": "Let's start by considering the possible values of $S(n)$. Since $S(n)$ is the sum of the digits of $n$, it must be between $0$ and $9$ inclusive. \n\nNext, let's consider the possible values of $S(S(n))$. Since $S(n)$ is between $0$ and $9$, $S(S(n))$ is also between $0$ and $9$. \n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $n$. Since $S(n)$ is between $0$ and $9$, $n$ must be between $2007-9-9=1989$ and $2007-0-0=2007$. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the number of values of $n$ between $1989$ and $2007$ such that $n+S(n)+S(S(n))=2007$. \n\nWe can start by trying out values of $n$ in this range. \n\nIf $n=1989$, then $S(n)=1+9+8+9=27$ and $S(S(n))=2+7=9$.

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the smallest positive integer $N$ with the following property: of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$, one of them is divisible by $2^2$, one of them is divisible by $3^2$, one is divisible by $5^2$, and one is divisible by $7^2$.", "solution": "The most efficient means of searching for this trio of integers is to begin with the multiples of $7^2$.  The first such number is 49, which almost works, since 50 is divisible by $5^2$ and 48 is divisible by $2^2$.  But none of the nearby numbers is divisible by $3^2$, so we move on to the next multiple of $7^2$, which is 98.  To our delight we discover that $3^2$ divides 99, while $2^2$ and $5^2$ divide 100.  Hence we should take $N=\\boxed{98}$.", "pred": "Step 1: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. We know that one of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ must be divisible by $2^2 = 4$.\n\nStep 2: Move on to the next prime number, which is 3. We know that one of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ must be divisible by $3^2 = 9$.\n\nStep 3: Move on to the next prime number, which is 5. We know that one of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ must be divisible by $5^2 = 25$.\n\nStep 4: Move on to the next prime number, which is 7. We know that one of the three numbers $N$, $N+1$, and $N+2$ must be divisible by $7^2 = 49$.\n\nStep 5: Combine the requirements from steps 1-4. We need to find the smallest positive integer $N$ that satisfies all of the requirements: $N$ must be divisible by 4, $N+1$ must be divisible by 9, $N+2$ must be divisible by 25, and $N+3$ must be divisible by 49.\n\nStep 6: Find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4, 9, 25, and 49. The LCM is 44100.\n\nStep 7: The smallest positive integer $N$ that satisfies all of the requirements is $\\boxed{44100}$."}

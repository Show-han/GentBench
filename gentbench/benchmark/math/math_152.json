{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Three different natural numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ each have exactly three natural-number factors. How many factors does $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ have?", "solution": "By the formula for the total number of positive divisors, only natural numbers in the form $p^{2}$ for some prime $p$ have exactly three positive factors. Thus, $x=p_1^2$, $y=p_2^2$, and $z=p_3^2$ for distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$. Then $x^2y^3z^4=p_1^4\\cdot p_2^6\\cdot p_3^8$, which has $(4+1)(6+1)(8+1)=\\boxed{315}$ positive factors.", "pred": "To find the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors of $x$, $y$, and $z$. \n\nSince $x$ has exactly three factors, it must be a perfect square. Therefore, $x$ can be written as $x = a^2$ for some natural number $a$. \n\nSimilarly, $y$ must be a perfect cube, so $y = b^3$ for some natural number $b$. \n\nFinally, $z$ must have exactly four factors, which means it must be a perfect fourth power. Thus, $z = c^4$ for some natural number $c$. \n\nSubstituting these expressions into $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$, we get $(a^2)^2(b^3)^3(c^4)^4 = a^4b^9c^{16}$. \n\nThe number of factors of $a^4b^9c^{16}$ can be found by considering the exponents of the prime factors. \n\nThe exponent of $a$ is $4$, so there are $4+1=5$ possible choices for the exponent of $a$. \n\nThe exponent of $b$ is $9$, so there are $9+1=10$ possible choices for the exponent of $b$. \n\nThe exponent of $c$ is $16$, so there are $16+1=17$ possible choices for the exponent of $c$. \n\nTherefore, the number of factors of $x^{2}y^{3}z^{4}$ is $5 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 17 = \\boxed{850}$."}

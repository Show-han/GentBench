{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many positive integers, not exceeding 100, are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4?", "solution": "The multiples of 2 from 1 to 100 are $2, 4, 6,\\ldots, 100$.  There are 50 such numbers.\n\nThe multiples of 3 from 1 to 100 are $3, 6, 9,\\ldots, 99$.  There are 33 such numbers.\n\nThese lists count all of the multiples of 6 twice.  The multiples of 6 are $6, 12,\\ldots,96$, and there are 16 such multiples of 6.  Therefore there are $50+33-16=67$ multiples of 2 or 3 from 1 to 100.\n\nAll of the 25 multiples of 4 from 1 to 100 are on this list.  Therefore there are $67-25=\\boxed{42}$ numbers from 1 to 100 that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4.", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Count the number of positive integers that are multiples of 2: There are 50 positive integers (2, 4, 6, ..., 100) that are multiples of 2.\n\n2. Count the number of positive integers that are multiples of 3: There are 33 positive integers (3, 6, 9, ..., 99) that are multiples of 3.\n\n3. Count the number of positive integers that are multiples of both 2 and 3 (i.e., multiples of 6): There are 16 positive integers (6, 12, 18, ..., 96) that are multiples of both 2 and 3.\n\n4. Subtract the number of positive integers that are multiples of both 2 and 3 from the total number of positive integers that are multiples of 2 or 3: 50 + 33 - 16 = 67.\n\nTherefore, there are 67 positive integers, not exceeding 100, that are multiples of 2 or 3 but not 4."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?", "solution": "For a number to leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, it must satisfy two conditions:\n\n1. it must divide exactly into $47 - 5$, or 42, and\n\n2. it must be greater than 5, because the divisor is always greater than the remainder.\n\nWe list all divisors of 42 in pairs. They are 1 and 42, 2 and 21, 3 and 14, 6 and 7. Of these, only 42, 21, 14, 6, and 7 are greater than 5. There are $\\boxed{5}$ different counting numbers that will leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47.", "pred": "To find the counting numbers that leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47, we need to consider the factors of 47. \n\nStep 1: Find the factors of 47. The factors of 47 are 1 and 47.\n\nStep 2: Subtract 5 from each factor. \n1 - 5 = -4\n47 - 5 = 42\n\nStep 3: Check if the result is a counting number. Since -4 is not a counting number, we can exclude it.\n\nTherefore, there is only one counting number (42) that leaves a remainder of 5 when divided into 47."}

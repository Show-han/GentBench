{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Call an integer $n$ oddly powerful if there exist positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$, $b$ is odd, and $a^b = n$. How many oddly powerful integers are less than $2010$?", "solution": "Let us first determine the number of cubes that are less than $2010$. We have $10^3 = 1000$, $11^3 = 1331$, and $12^3 = 1728$, but $13^3 = 2197$. So there are $12$ cubes less than $2010$. As for fifth powers, $4^5 = 1024$, but $5^5 = 3125$. There are $4$ fifth powers less than $2010$, but only $3$ of these have not already been included, since we've already counted 1. Analyzing seventh powers, $3^7 = 2187$, so the only new seventh power less than $2010$ is $2^7$. There are no new ninth powers since they are all cubes, and $2^{11} = 2048$ is greater than 2010. Therefore, there are $12+3+1 = \\boxed{16}$ oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.", "pred": "To find the oddly powerful integers less than $2010$, we need to find all possible values of $n$ such that $n = a^b$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$, where $b>1$ and $b$ is odd.\n\nStep 1: Start with $a=2$. Find all odd values of $b$ such that $2^b<2010$.\nThe largest odd value of $b$ such that $2^b<2010$ is $b=9$. So, $2^9=512$ is the largest oddly powerful integer less than $2010$ that can be obtained by raising $2$ to an odd power.\n\nStep 2: Repeat Step 1 for $a=3$, $a=4$, $a=5$, and so on, until $a=44$.\nFor $a=3$, the largest odd value of $b$ such that $3^b<2010$ is $b=6$. So, $3^6=729$ is an oddly powerful integer less than $2010$.\nFor $a=4$, the largest odd value of $b$ such that $4^b<2010$ is $b=3$. So, $4^3=64$ is an oddly powerful integer less than $2010$.\nFor $a=5$, the largest odd value of $b$ such that $5^b<2010$ is $b=3$. So, $5^3=125$ is an oddly powerful integer less than $2010$.\nContinuing this process, we find that $6^2=36$, $7^2=49$, $8^2=64$, $9^2=81$, $10^2=100$, $11^2=121$, $12^2=144$, $13^2=169$, $14^2=196$, $15^2=225$, $16^2=256$, $17^2=289$, $18^2=324$, $19^2=361$, $20^2=400$, $21^2=441$, $22^2=484$, $23^2=529$, $24^2=576$, $25^2=625$, $26^2=676$, $27^2=729$, $28^2=784$, $29^2=841$, $30^2=900$, $31^2=961$, $32^2=1024$, $33^2=1089$, $34^2=1156$, $35^2=1225$, $36^2=1296$, $37^2=1369$, $38^2=1444$, $39^2=1521$, $40^2=1600$, $41^2=1681$, $42^2=1764$, $43^2=1849$, and $44^2=1936$ are all oddly powerful integers less than $2010$.\n\nStep 3: Count the total number of oddly powerful integers found in Step 2.\nThere are $9$ oddly powerful integers obtained from $a=2$, $6$ oddly powerful integers obtained from $a=3$, and $36$ oddly powerful integers obtained from $a=4$ to $a=44$. Therefore, the total number of oddly powerful integers less than $2010$ is $9+6+36=\\boxed{51}$."}

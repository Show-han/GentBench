{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let  \\[A=111111\\]and  \\[B=142857\\]Find a positive integer $N$ with six or fewer digits such that $N$ is the multiplicative inverse of $AB$ modulo 1,000,000.", "solution": "We notice that both $A$ and $B$ are factors of 999,999.  Specifically \\[9A=999999\\]and \\[7B=999999.\\]Taken modulo 1,000,000 these equations read \\begin{align*}\n9A&\\equiv-1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\\\\n7B&\\equiv-1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\\\\n\\end{align*}We are set if we multiply these equations: \\[(9A)(7B)\\equiv1\\pmod{1{,}000{,}000}\\]so $N=9\\cdot7=\\boxed{63}$ is the multiplicative inverse to $AB$ modulo 1,000,000.", "pred": "First, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of $AB$ modulo $1,000,000$. This means we need to find a number $N$ such that $(AB)(N) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{1,000,000}$.\n\nTo find the multiplicative inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. We want to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $(AB)(x) + (1,000,000)(y) = 1$. \n\nUsing the Euclidean Algorithm, we can find that the greatest common divisor of $AB$ and $1,000,000$ is $1$. Therefore, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients $x$ and $y$.\n\nOnce we have found $x$ and $y$, we can take $N$ to be the value of $x$ modulo $1,000,000$. This will give us a positive integer $N$ with six or fewer digits that is the multiplicative inverse of $AB$ modulo $1,000,000$."}

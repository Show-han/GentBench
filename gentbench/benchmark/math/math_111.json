{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the greatest common divisor of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$?", "solution": "Let $m = 2^{1998} - 1$ and $n = 2^{1989}-1$. Then, $2^9n = 2^9(2^{1989}-1) = 2^{1998} - 2^9 = m - (2^9 - 1)$. By the Euclidean algorithm, it follows that \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,(m,n) &= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,m-2^9n) \\\\\n&= \\text{gcd}\\,(n,2^9-1). \\\\\n\\end{align*}Since $9$ divides $1998$, by the difference of odd powers factorization, it follows that $2^{1989}-1$ is divisible by $2^9 - 1$. Thus, the greatest common divisor of $m$ and $n$ is $2^9 - 1 = \\boxed{511}$.", "pred": "We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$. \n\nStep 1: Divide $2^{1998}-1$ by $2^{1989}-1$ to get a quotient and remainder. The quotient is $2^9 = 512$ and the remainder is $511$.\n\nStep 2: Divide $2^{1989}-1$ by $511$ to get a quotient and remainder. The quotient is $2^{1989}/511$ and the remainder is $2^{1989} \\mod 511$.\n\nStep 3: Repeat step 2 with the remainder from step 2 and the previous remainder until the remainder is $0$.\n\nSince $511$ is a power of $2$ minus $1$, we know that $2^{1989} \\equiv 1 \\mod 511$. Therefore, the remainder in step 2 is $1$.\n\nSince the remainder is $1$, the GCD of $2^{1998}-1$ and $2^{1989}-1$ is $1$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}?$", "solution": "Recall that, by definition,  $531n \\equiv 1067n \\pmod{24}$ means that $531n-1067n$ is divisible by 24. In other words,  $$\\frac{1067n-531n}{24} = \\frac{536n}{24}=\\frac{67n}{3}$$must be an integer. Since $67$ and $3$ are relatively prime, $n$ must be a multiple of $3$, the smallest of which is $\\boxed{3}$.", "pred": "First, we can simplify the congruence by canceling out the common factor of $n$ on both sides. This gives us $531 \\equiv 1067 \\pmod{24}$. \n\nNext, we can simplify the congruence further by subtracting $531$ from both sides. This gives us $1067 - 531 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. \n\nSimplifying the left side gives us $536 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{24}$. \n\nFinally, we can find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies this congruence by finding the smallest positive multiple of $24$ that is greater than or equal to $536$. \n\nThe smallest positive multiple of $24$ that is greater than or equal to $536$ is $24 \\cdot 23 = 552$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies the congruence is $\\boxed{23}$."}

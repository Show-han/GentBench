{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Determine the sum of all prime numbers $p$ for which there exists no integer solution in $x$ to the congruence $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p$.", "solution": "Firstly, the congruence can be simplified to $3(6x+1)\\equiv 4\\pmod p\\implies 18x\\equiv 1\\pmod p$. This is solvable for $x$ if and only if $18$ is invertible modulo $p$, meaning $\\gcd(18,p)=1$. Since the prime factors of $18$ are $2,3$, these are precisely the prime moduli for which an $x$ cannot exist since then $\\gcd(18,p)>1$. Thus, the desired number is $2+3=\\boxed{5}$.", "pred": "Step 1: Start by simplifying the congruence equation. Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 modulo p, which is the number that satisfies $3^{-1}\\cdot 3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. This gives us $6x+1 \\equiv 3^{-1}\\cdot 4 \\pmod p$.\n\nStep 2: Now we want to find the inverse of 3 modulo p. If p is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by p, then the inverse of 3 modulo p exists. In other words, we need to find a number a such that $3a \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. This can be done using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.\n\nStep 3: Once we have found the inverse of 3 modulo p, we can substitute it back into the congruence equation. This gives us $6x+1 \\equiv a\\cdot 4 \\pmod p$.\n\nStep 4: Now we want to find the values of p for which there exists no integer solution in x to the congruence equation. This happens when the right-hand side of the congruence equation, $a\\cdot 4$, is not congruent to any integer modulo p. In other words, $a\\cdot 4$ must not be divisible by p.\n\nStep 5: To determine the sum of all prime numbers p for which there exists no integer solution in x, we need to find the sum of all prime numbers p that do not divide $a\\cdot 4$."}

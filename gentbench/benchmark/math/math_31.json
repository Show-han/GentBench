{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the largest positive integer $n$ for which there is a unique integer $k$ such that $\\frac{8}{15} < \\frac{n}{n + k} < \\frac{7}{13}$?\n", "solution": "Multiplying out all of the denominators, we get:\n\\begin{align*}104(n+k) &< 195n< 105(n+k)\\\\ 0 &< 91n - 104k < n + k\\end{align*}\nSince $91n - 104k < n + k$, $k > \\frac{6}{7}n$. Also, $0 < 91n - 104k$, so $k < \\frac{7n}{8}$. Thus, $48n < 56k < 49n$. $k$ is unique if it is within a maximum range of $112$, so $n = \\boxed{112}$.", "pred": "First, we can cross-multiply the inequalities to get $13n < 7(n+k) < 15n$. \n\nExpanding the middle inequality gives $7n + 7k < 15n$. Subtracting $7n$ from both sides gives $7k < 8n$. \n\nSimilarly, expanding the first inequality gives $13n < 7n + 7k$. Subtracting $7n$ from both sides gives $6n < 7k$. \n\nCombining these inequalities, we have $6n < 7k < 8n$. \n\nTo find the largest possible value of $n$, we want to minimize the value of $k$. The smallest possible value of $k$ is $k = 6n$, which satisfies the inequalities. \n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{6}$."}

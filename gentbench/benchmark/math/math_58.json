{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A number is divisible by $9$ if the sum of its digits is divisible by $9.$ For example, the number $19\\,836$ is divisible by $9$ but $19\\,825$ is not.\n\nIf $D\\,767\\,E89$ is divisible by $9,$ where $D$ and $E$ each represent a single digit, what is the sum of all possible values of the sum $D+E?$", "solution": "For $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ we must have $$D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37+D+E$$ divisible by $9.$ Since $D$ and $E$ are each a single digit, we know each is between $0$ and $9.$ Therefore, $D+E$ is between $0$ and $18.$ Therefore, $37+D+E$ is between $37$ and $55.$ The numbers between $37$ and $55$ that are divisible by $9$ are $45$ and $54.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=45,$ then $D+E=8.$\n\nIf $37+D+E=54,$ then $D+E=17.$\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $D+E$ are $8$ and $17.$ Our answer is then $8+17=\\boxed{25}.$", "pred": "The sum of the digits of $D\\,767\\,E89$ is $D+7+6+7+E+8+9 = 37 + D + E.$ In order for $D\\,767\\,E89$ to be divisible by $9,$ the sum of its digits must be divisible by $9.$ Therefore, $37 + D + E$ must be divisible by $9.$\n\nThe possible values for $D$ and $E$ are $0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.$ We want to find the sum of all possible values of $D+E.$\n\nIf $D+E$ is divisible by $9,$ then $37 + D + E$ is also divisible by $9.$ Therefore, we want to find the sum of all possible values of $D+E$ that are congruent to $-37$ modulo $9.$\n\nThe possible values of $D+E$ are $0, 1, 2, \\dots, 18.$ The numbers congruent to $-37$ modulo $9$ are $-1, -10, -19, \\dots, -55.$\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so the sum of the numbers congruent to $-37$ modulo $9$ is\n\\[\\frac{(-1) + (-55)}{2} \\cdot 7 = -28 \\cdot 7 = -196.\\]Therefore, the sum of all possible values of $D+E$ is $\\boxed{-196}.$"}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The harmonic mean of two positive integers is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of their reciprocals. For how many ordered pairs of positive integers $(x,y)$ with $x<y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ equal to $6^{20}$?\n", "solution": "The harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{\\frac{\\frac{1}{x}+\\frac{1}{y}}2} = \\frac{2xy}{x+y}$, so we have $xy=(x+y)(3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})$, and by SFFT, $(x-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})(y-3^{20}\\cdot2^{19})=3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$. Now, $3^{40}\\cdot2^{38}$ has $41\\cdot39=1599$ factors, one of which is the square root ($3^{20}2^{19}$). Since $x<y$, the answer is half of the remaining number of factors, which is $\\frac{1599-1}{2}= \\boxed{799}$.", "pred": "Let $h$ be the harmonic mean of $x$ and $y$. We have $\\frac{2}{h} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y}}{2} = \\frac{x+y}{xy}$. Since $h = 6^{20}$, we have $\\frac{2}{6^{20}} = \\frac{x+y}{xy}$. Cross-multiplying gives $2xy = 6^{20}(x+y)$. Rearranging gives $2xy - 6^{20}x - 6^{20}y = 0$. Applying Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we add $6^{20}^2$ to both sides to get $2xy - 6^{20}x - 6^{20}y + 6^{20}^2 = 6^{20}^2$. Factoring the left side gives $(x-6^{20})(y-6^{20}) = 6^{40}$. Since $x < y$, we have $x-6^{20} < y-6^{20}$, so $x-6^{20}$ must be a divisor of $6^{40}$. There are $41 \\cdot 2 = 82$ divisors of $6^{40}$, so there are $\\boxed{82}$ possible values of $x$."}

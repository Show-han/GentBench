{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many even perfect square factors does $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ have?", "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.", "pred": "To find the number of even perfect square factors, we need to consider the exponents of the prime factors. \n\nThe prime factorization of $2^4 \\cdot 7^9$ is $2^4 \\cdot 7^9 = (2^2)^2 \\cdot 7^9$. \n\nSince we want even perfect square factors, we need to consider the exponents of $2$ that are divisible by $2$. In this case, the only exponent that is divisible by $2$ is $4$. \n\nTherefore, there is only $1$ even perfect square factor, which is $2^4$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A group of 25 friends were discussing a large positive integer. ``It can be divided by 1,'' said the first friend. ``It can be divided by 2,'' said the second friend. ``And by 3,'' said the third friend. ``And by 4,'' added the fourth friend. This continued until everyone had made such a comment. If exactly two friends were incorrect, and those two friends said consecutive numbers, what was the least possible integer they were discussing?", "solution": "Let $N$ denote the large positive integer that everyone is discussing.\n\nThe two incorrect numbers are consecutive numbers.  To get the smallest possible value of $N$, we must maximize the incorrect numbers. As such, we should start with the highest possible incorrect numbers and work down.\n\nSuppose the two incorrect numbers are 24 and 25.  Then $N$ must still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 23.$  This means $N$ is divisible by 3 and 8, so $N$ is divisible by $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$, contradiction.  So the two incorrect numbers cannot be 24 and 25.  We can eliminate the other high cases similarly.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 22, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 11.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 20, because $N$ would still be divisible by 4 and 5.\n\nOne of the incorrect numbers cannot be 18, because $N$ would still be divisible by 2 and 9.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the incorrect numbers were 16 and 17.  Then $N$ would still be divisible by $1, 2, 3, \\dots, 15, 18, 19, \\dots, 25$.  The lcm of these remaining numbers is\n\\[2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 23 = 787386600,\\]which is not divisible by 16 or 17.  Thus, the incorrect numbers can be 16 and 17, and the smallest possible value of $N$ is $\\boxed{787386600}$.", "pred": "Since exactly two friends were incorrect and those two friends said consecutive numbers, we know that the integer cannot be divisible by both of those consecutive numbers. Therefore, the integer must be divisible by all other numbers that the friends mentioned.\n\nThe friends mentioned the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 24, 25. To find the least possible integer, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.\n\nPrime factorizing each number, we have:\n1 = 1\n2 = 2\n3 = 3\n4 = 2^2\n5 = 5\n6 = 2 * 3\n7 = 7\n8 = 2^3\n9 = 3^2\n10 = 2 * 5\n11 = 11\n12 = 2^2 * 3\n13 = 13\n14 = 2 * 7\n15 = 3 * 5\n16 = 2^4\n17 = 17\n18 = 2 * 3^2\n19 = 19\n20 = 2^2 * 5\n21 = 3 * 7\n22 = 2 * 11\n23 = 23\n24 = 2^3 * 3\n25 = 5^2\n\nTaking the highest power of each prime factor, we have:\n2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23\n\nCalculating this product, we find that the least possible integer they were discussing is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23 = 232,792,560."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Recall that a perfect square is the square of some integer.  How many perfect squares less than 10,000 can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares?", "solution": "We want a perfect square $a^2$ to be represented as $(b+1)^2-b^2$ for some nonnegative integer $b$. We can rewrite the difference of squares as $(b+1-b)(b+1+b)=1(2b+1)$. This means that we must be able to represent $a^2$ as $2b+1$ where $b$ is a nonnegative integer. But every positive odd integer can be represented in this form, so every odd perfect square from $1^2$ to $99^2$ satisfies this condition. Since there are 50 odd numbers from 1 to 99, there are $\\boxed{50}$ such perfect squares.", "pred": "To find the perfect squares that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the first perfect square, which is 1.\n2. Find the next perfect square by adding 2 to the previous perfect square. (1 + 2 = 3)\n3. Calculate the difference between the current perfect square and the previous perfect square. (3 - 1 = 2)\n4. Check if the difference is a perfect square itself. If it is, count it as one of the perfect squares that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the perfect square exceeds 10,000.\n6. Count the total number of perfect squares found in step 4.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of perfect squares less than 10,000 that can be represented as the difference of two consecutive perfect squares."}

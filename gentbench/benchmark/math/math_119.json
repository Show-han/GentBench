{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Define a positive integer $n$ to be a factorial tail if there is some positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes. How many positive integers less than $1992$ are not factorial tails?\n", "solution": "Let the number of zeros at the end of $m!$ be $f(m)$. We have $f(m) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{625} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{3125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots$.\nNote that if $m$ is a multiple of $5$, $f(m) = f(m+1) = f(m+2) = f(m+3) = f(m+4)$.\nSince $f(m) \\le \\frac{m}{5} + \\frac{m}{25} + \\frac{m}{125} + \\cdots  = \\frac{m}{4}$, a value of $m$ such that $f(m) = 1991$ is greater than $7964$. Testing values greater than this yields $f(7975)=1991$.\nThere are $\\frac{7975}{5} = 1595$ distinct positive integers, $f(m)$, less than $1992$. Thus, there are $1991-1595 = \\boxed{396}$ positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails.", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails, we need to find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that do not have a corresponding positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes.\n\nTo do this, we can count the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that have a corresponding positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes, and subtract this from the total number of positive integers less than $1992$.\n\nTo find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that have a corresponding positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes, we need to find the largest value of $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes.\n\nThe number of zeroes at the end of $m!$ is determined by the number of factors of $10$ in $m!$. Since $10 = 2 \\times 5$, we need to count the number of factors of $2$ and $5$ in $m!$.\n\nThe number of factors of $2$ in $m!$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{2^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\dotsb$.\n\nThe number of factors of $5$ in $m!$ is given by $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^2} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{5^3} \\right\\rfloor + \\dotsb$.\n\nSince there are more factors of $2$ than factors of $5$ in $m!$, the number of zeroes at the end of $m!$ is determined by the number of factors of $5$ in $m!$.\n\nTo find the largest value of $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes, we need to find the largest value of $m$ such that the number of factors of $5$ in $m!$ is equal to $n$.\n\nWe can find this largest value of $m$ by using a binary search algorithm. We start with a lower bound of $0$ and an upper bound of $1992$, and repeatedly check the middle value between the lower and upper bounds. If the number of factors of $5$ in the middle value is greater than $n$, we update the upper bound to be the middle value minus $1$. If the number of factors of $5$ in the middle value is less than $n$, we update the lower bound to be the middle value plus $1$. We continue this process until the lower bound is greater than the upper bound.\n\nOnce we have found the largest value of $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes, we can calculate the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that have a corresponding positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes by dividing $1992$ by $m$ and taking the floor.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that have a corresponding positive integer $m$ such that the decimal representation of $m!$ ends with exactly $n$ zeroes from the total number of positive integers less than $1992$ to find the number of positive integers less than $1992$ that are not factorial tails."}

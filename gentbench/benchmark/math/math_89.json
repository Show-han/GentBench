{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Suppose that  $a$ and $b$ are digits, not both nine and not both zero, and the repeating decimal  $0.\\overline{ab}$ is expressed as a fraction in lowest terms. How many different denominators are possible?", "solution": "Since $0.\\overline{ab} = \\frac{ab}{99}$, the denominator must be a factor of $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$. The factors of $99$ are $1,$ $3,$ $9,$ $11,$ $33,$ and  $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are not both nine,  the denominator cannot be $1$. By choosing $a$ and $b$ appropriately,  we can make fractions with each of the other denominators.\n\nThus, the answer is $\\boxed{5}$.", "pred": "To express the repeating decimal $0.\\overline{ab}$ as a fraction in lowest terms, we can use the concept of geometric series. \n\nStep 1: Write the repeating decimal as a fraction without the repeating part. \nSince $0.\\overline{ab}$ is a repeating decimal, we can write it as $\\frac{ab}{99}$, since there are two digits repeating and the denominator is $99$.\n\nStep 2: Simplify the fraction $\\frac{ab}{99}$ to its lowest terms. \nTo simplify the fraction, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $ab$ and $99$. Since $a$ and $b$ are digits, the possible values for $ab$ are $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, 98$. \n\nStep 3: Count the number of different denominators possible. \nTo find the number of different denominators possible, we need to count the number of different GCDs we can obtain. \n\nLet's consider the possible values for $ab$:\n- If $ab = 10$, the GCD of $10$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 11$, the GCD of $11$ and $99$ is $11$.\n- If $ab = 12$, the GCD of $12$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 13$, the GCD of $13$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 14$, the GCD of $14$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 15$, the GCD of $15$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 16$, the GCD of $16$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 17$, the GCD of $17$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 18$, the GCD of $18$ and $99$ is $9$.\n- If $ab = 19$, the GCD of $19$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 20$, the GCD of $20$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 21$, the GCD of $21$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 22$, the GCD of $22$ and $99$ is $11$.\n- If $ab = 23$, the GCD of $23$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 24$, the GCD of $24$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 25$, the GCD of $25$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 26$, the GCD of $26$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 27$, the GCD of $27$ and $99$ is $9$.\n- If $ab = 28$, the GCD of $28$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 29$, the GCD of $29$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 30$, the GCD of $30$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 31$, the GCD of $31$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 32$, the GCD of $32$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 33$, the GCD of $33$ and $99$ is $33$.\n- If $ab = 34$, the GCD of $34$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 35$, the GCD of $35$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 36$, the GCD of $36$ and $99$ is $9$.\n- If $ab = 37$, the GCD of $37$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 38$, the GCD of $38$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 39$, the GCD of $39$ and $99$ is $3$.\n- If $ab = 40$, the GCD of $40$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 41$, the GCD of $41$ and $99$ is $1$.\n- If $ab = 42$, the GCD"}

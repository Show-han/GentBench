{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $n$ represent the smallest integer that satisfies the following conditions:\n$\\frac n2$ is a perfect square.\n$\\frac n3$ is a perfect cube.\n$\\frac n5$ is a perfect fifth.\nHow many divisors does $n$ have that are not multiples of 10?\n", "solution": "The first condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be an even power (excluding $2$, which must be an odd power). The second condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $3$ (excluding $3$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $3$). The third condition implies that the power of each prime factor of $n$ must be divisible by $5$ (excluding $5$, which must leave a residue of $1$ upon division by $5$).\nClearly, to minimize $n$, we want to just use the prime factors $2,3,5$. The power of $2$ must be divisible by $3,5$, and $2^{15}$ works. Similarly, the powers of $3$ and $5$ must be $10$ and $6$, respectively, both of which leave a residue of $1$ upon division. Thus, we need the number of factors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ which are not multiples of $10$.\nApplying the complement principle, there are a total of $(15+1)(10+1)(6+1) = 1232$ factors. We can draw a bijection between the number of divisors of $2^{15} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{6}$ that are divisible by $10$ and the number of divisors of $2^{14} \\cdot 3^{10} \\cdot 5^{5}$ (as each of these divisors, when multiplied by 10, will provide a factor of the original number that is divisible by 10). There are $(14+1)(10+1)(5+1) = 990$. The answer is $1232-990 = \\boxed{242}$.", "pred": "Let's start by finding the prime factorization of $n$. Since $\\frac{n}{2}$ is a perfect square, $n$ must have an even power of 2 in its prime factorization. Similarly, since $\\frac{n}{3}$ is a perfect cube, $n$ must have a power of 3 in its prime factorization that is divisible by 3. Finally, since $\\frac{n}{5}$ is a perfect fifth, $n$ must have a power of 5 in its prime factorization that is divisible by 5.\n\nLet $2^a3^b5^c$ be the prime factorization of $n$. From the given conditions, we know that $a$ is even, $b$ is divisible by 3, and $c$ is divisible by 5.\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of $n$, we want to minimize $a$, $b$, and $c$. Since $a$ must be even, the smallest possible value is $a=2$. Similarly, the smallest possible value for $b$ is $b=3$, and the smallest possible value for $c$ is $c=5$.\n\nTherefore, the prime factorization of $n$ is $2^23^35^5$. To find the number of divisors of $n$ that are not multiples of 10, we count the number of divisors of $n$ and subtract the number of divisors that are multiples of 10.\n\nThe number of divisors of $n$ is $(2+1)(3+1)(5+1) = 72$. The divisors that are multiples of 10 are those that have at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 5. There are $(2+1)(5+1) = 18$ such divisors.\n\nTherefore, the number of divisors of $n$ that are not multiples of 10 is $72 - 18 = \\boxed{54}$."}

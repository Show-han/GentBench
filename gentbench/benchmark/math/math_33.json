{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the largest integer that is a divisor of \\[\n(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)\n\\]for all positive even integers $n$?", "solution": "Among five consecutive odd numbers, at least one is divisible by 3 and exactly one is divisible by 5, so the product is always divisible by 15. The cases $n=2$, $n=10$, and $n=12$ demonstrate that no larger common divisor is possible, since $\\boxed{15}$ is the greatest common divisor of $3\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot9\\cdot11$, $11\\cdot13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19$, and $13\\cdot15\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot21$.", "pred": "We can start by factoring out a $2$ from each term in the expression $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ to get \\[\n2(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9).\n\\]Since $n$ is even, each of the terms $n+1$, $n+3$, $n+5$, $n+7$, and $n+9$ are odd. Therefore, each of these terms is congruent to $1$ modulo $2$. So, we can write \\[\n2(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9) \\equiv 2(1)(1)(1)(1)(1) \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}.\n\\]This means that $2(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ is not divisible by $4$. Therefore, the largest integer that is a divisor of $(n+1)(n+3)(n+5)(n+7)(n+9)$ for all positive even integers $n$ is $\\boxed{2}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses paint a very long picket fence.\nHarold starts with the first picket and paints every $h$ th picket;\nTanya starts with the second picket and paints every $t$ th picket; and\nUlysses starts with the third picket and paints every $u$ th picket.\nCall the positive integer $100h+10t+u$ paintable when the triple $(h,t,u)$ of positive integers results in every picket being painted exactly once. Find the sum of all the paintable integers.\n", "solution": "Note that it is impossible for any of $h,t,u$ to be $1$, since then each picket will have been painted one time, and then some will be painted more than once.\n$h$ cannot be $2$, or that will result in painting the third picket twice. If $h=3$, then $t$ may not equal anything not divisible by $3$, and the same for $u$. Now for fourth and fifth pickets to be painted, $t$ and $u$ must be $3$ as well. This configuration works, so $333$ is paintable.\nIf $h$ is $4$, then $t$ must be even. The same for $u$, except that it can't be $2 \\mod 4$. Thus $u$ is $0 \\mod 4$ and $t$ is $2 \\mod 4$. Since this is all $\\mod 4$, $t$ must be $2$ and $u$ must be $4$, in order for $5,6$ to be paint-able. Thus $424$ is paintable.\n$h$ cannot be greater than $5$, since if that were the case then the answer would be greater than $999$, which would be impossible for the AIME.\nThus the sum of all paintable numbers is $\\boxed{757}$.", "pred": "We can start by considering the least common multiple (LCM) of $h$, $t$, and $u$. Let $L$ be the LCM of $h$, $t$, and $u$. Since Harold starts with the first picket, Tanya starts with the second picket, and Ulysses starts with the third picket, the LCM $L$ must be divisible by $3$. \n\nNow, let's consider the pickets that are painted by Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses. Harold paints every $h$th picket, so the pickets he paints are $1, h+1, 2h+1, 3h+1, \\ldots$. Similarly, Tanya paints every $t$th picket, so the pickets she paints are $2, t+2, 2t+2, 3t+2, \\ldots$. Ulysses paints every $u$th picket, so the pickets he paints are $3, u+3, 2u+3, 3u+3, \\ldots$. \n\nSince every picket must be painted exactly once, the pickets painted by Harold, Tanya, and Ulysses must cover all the positive integers from $1$ to $L$. Therefore, we have the following equations:\n\\begin{align*} 1 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ 2 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ 3 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*} 2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ t+2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ 2t+2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*} 3 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod u \\\\ u+3 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod u \\\\ 2u+3 &\\equiv 3 \\pmod u \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 3 \\pmod u \\end{align*}\n\nSince $L$ is divisible by $3$, we can rewrite the equations as:\n\\begin{align*} 1 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ 2 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ 3 &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 1 \\pmod h \\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*} 2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ 2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ 2 &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 2 \\pmod t \\end{align*}\n\\begin{align*} 3 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod u \\\\ 3 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod u \\\\ 3 &\\equiv 0 \\pmod u \\\\ &\\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ L &\\equiv 0 \\pmod u \\end{align*}\n\nFrom the first set of equations, we can see that $h$ must be a divisor of $2$. Since $h$ is a positive integer, $h$ can only be $1$ or $2$. \n\nFrom the second set of equations, we can see that $t$ must be a divisor of $2$. Since $t$ is a positive integer, $t$ can only be $1$ or $2$. \n\nFrom the third set of equations, we can see that $u$ must be a divisor of $3$. Since $u$ is a positive integer, $u$ can only be $1$ or $3$. \n\nTherefore, the possible values for $(h,t,u)$ are $(1,1,1)$, $(1,1,3)$, $(1,2,1)$, $(1,2,3)$, $(2,1,1)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(2,2,1)$, and $(2,2,3)$. \n\nThe corresponding paintable integers are $111$, $113$, $121$, $123$, $211$, $213$, $221$, and $223$. \n\nThe sum of all the paintable integers is $111+113+121+123+211+213+221+223=\\boxed{1335}$."}

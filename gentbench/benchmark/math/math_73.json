{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The number $1000!$ has a long tail of zeroes. How many zeroes are there?  (Reminder: The number $n!$ is the product of the integers from 1 to $n$.  For example, $5!=5\\cdot 4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot 1= 120$.)", "solution": "You get a digit $0$ on the end of a number whenever it has a factor of $10$, so the question is really asking, how many $10$s are in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot5$, we need to count how many of each there are. We're going to have more $2$s than $5$s, so we actually only need to count how many times $5$ appears in the prime factorization.\n\nTo count how many times a number is divisible by $5$, we divide $1000$ by $5$ to get $200$. Each of those two hundred numbers has a factor of $5$.\n\nNext, how many of the numbers are divisible by $5^2=25$? Dividing $1000$ by $25$, we get $40$. Each of them has two factors of $5$. We've already counted one of them for each number, so for these forty multiples of $25$, we need to add a factor for each to our count.\n\nNext, we need to look at numbers that have $5^3=125$ in them. Eight of our numbers are divisible by $125$, so we count $8$ more factors of $5$.\n\nFinally, we look at $5^4=625$. There is only one number among $1$ through $1000$ divisible by $625$, and that number is $625$, so we only need to count one more factor of $5$. Since $5^5$ is too big, we can stop here.\n\nThis gives a total of $200+40+8+1=249$ factors of $5$ in $1000!$, so it has $\\boxed{249}$ zeroes on the end.", "pred": "To determine the number of zeroes at the end of $1000!$, we need to count the number of factors of $10$ in the prime factorization of $1000!$. Since $10=2\\cdot 5$, we need to count the number of factors of $2$ and $5$.\n\nFirst, we count the number of factors of $5$. We know that every multiple of $5$ contributes at least one factor of $5$. There are $\\frac{1000}{5}=200$ multiples of $5$ less than or equal to $1000$. However, some numbers contribute more than one factor of $5$. For example, $25$ contributes two factors of $5$, and $125$ contributes three factors of $5$. We can count the number of multiples of $25$ by dividing $1000$ by $25$, which gives $\\frac{1000}{25}=40$. Similarly, we can count the number of multiples of $125$ by dividing $1000$ by $125$, which gives $\\frac{1000}{125}=8$. Notice that we don't need to count the number of multiples of $625$ since $625$ is greater than $1000$. Adding up these counts, we have $200+40+8=248$ factors of $5$.\n\nNext, we count the number of factors of $2$. Every even number contributes at least one factor of $2$. There are $\\frac{1000}{2}=500$ even numbers less than or equal to $1000$. However, some numbers contribute more than one factor of $2$. For example, $4$ contributes two factors of $2$, and $8$ contributes three factors of $2$. We can count the number of multiples of $4$ by dividing $1000$ by $4$, which gives $\\frac{1000}{4}=250$. Similarly, we can count the number of multiples of $8$ by dividing $1000$ by $8$, which gives $\\frac{1000}{8}=125$. Notice that we don't need to count the number of multiples of $16$ since $16$ is greater than $1000$. Adding up these counts, we have $500+250+125=875$ factors of $2$.\n\nSince every factor of $10$ contributes one factor of $2$ and one factor of $5$, the number of factors of $10$ is equal to the smaller of the counts of factors of $2$ and factors of $5$. In this case, the smaller count is $248$. Therefore, there are $\\boxed{248}$ zeroes at the end of $1000!$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $n$ be an odd integer with exactly 11 positive divisors.  Find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$.", "solution": "Since $t(n) = 11$ is prime and is the product of 1 more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization of $n$, there can be only one exponent, and therefore one prime in the prime factorization of $n$.  This means $n = p^{10}$ for some odd prime number $p$, so $$ 8n^3 = 2^3 \\cdot p^{30} \\qquad \\Rightarrow \\qquad t(8n^3) = (3 + 1)(30 + 1) = \\boxed{124}. $$", "pred": "First, we know that $n$ has exactly 11 positive divisors. Since $n$ is odd, it must be in the form $n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}\\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, where $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_k$ are distinct primes and $a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_k$ are positive integers. \n\nSince $n$ has 11 positive divisors, we know that $(a_1+1)(a_2+1)\\cdots(a_k+1)=11$. Since 11 is prime, we must have one of the $a_i+1$ equal to 11 and the rest equal to 1. Therefore, $n$ must be in the form $n=p^a$ for some prime $p$ and positive integer $a$.\n\nNow, we want to find the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$. Since $n=p^a$, we have $8n^3=8(p^a)^3=8p^{3a}$. The prime factorization of $8$ is $2^3$, so we can write $8p^{3a}$ as $2^3p^{3a}$. \n\nThe number of positive divisors of $2^3p^{3a}$ is equal to $(3+1)(3a+1)$, since we can choose any power of 2 from 0 to 3 and any power of $p$ from 0 to $3a$. Therefore, the number of positive divisors of $8n^3$ is $(3+1)(3a+1)=\\boxed{16(3a+1)}$."}

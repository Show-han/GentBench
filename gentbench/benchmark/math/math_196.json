{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The members of a band are arranged in a rectangular formation. When they are arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied in the formation. When they are arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. How many members are in the band if the membership is between 100 and 200?", "solution": "The number of members in the band leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 8 and a remainder of 6 when divided by 9.  Therefore, the number of members is 6 more than a multiple of $9\\times8=72$.  The only such number between 100 and 200 is $72\\cdot 2 + 6=150$, so there are $\\boxed{150}$ members.", "pred": "Let's solve this problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of columns in the rectangular formation.\n- When arranged in 8 rows, there are 2 positions unoccupied. This means there are 8 rows * (number of columns) + 2 = 8c + 2 positions in total.\n- When arranged in 9 rows, there are 3 positions unoccupied. This means there are 9 rows * (number of columns) + 3 = 9c + 3 positions in total.\n\nStep 2: Set up equations based on the given information.\n- From step 1, we have the equations: 8c + 2 = total positions and 9c + 3 = total positions.\n\nStep 3: Solve the equations to find the number of columns.\n- Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get: (8c + 2) - (9c + 3) = 0.\n- Simplifying, we have: -c - 1 = 0.\n- Solving for c, we find: c = -1.\n\nStep 4: Determine the number of members in the band.\n- Since the number of columns cannot be negative, we discard the solution c = -1.\n- Therefore, there is no valid solution within the given range of 100 to 200 members.\n\nConclusion: There is no valid solution for the number of members in the band between 100 and 200, given the information provided."}

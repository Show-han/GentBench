{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $m \\ge 3$ be an integer and let $S = \\{3,4,5,\\ldots,m\\}$. Find the smallest value of $m$ such that for every partition of $S$ into two subsets, at least one of the subsets contains integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ (not necessarily distinct) such that $ab = c$.\n", "solution": "We claim that $243$ is the minimal value of $m$. Let the two partitioned sets be $A$ and $B$; we will try to partition $3, 9, 27, 81,$ and $243$ such that the $ab=c$ condition is not satisfied. Without loss of generality, we place $3$ in $A$. Then $9$ must be placed in $B$, so $81$ must be placed in $A$, and $27$ must be placed in $B$. Then $243$ cannot be placed in any set, so we know $m$ is less than or equal to $243$.\nFor $m \\le 242$, we can partition $S$ into $S \\cap \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 81, 82, 83, 84 ... 242\\}$ and $S \\cap \\{9, 10, 11 ... 80\\}$, and in neither set are there values where $ab=c$ (since $8 < (3\\text{ to }8)^2 < 81$ and $(9\\text{ to }80)^2 > 80$). Thus $m = \\boxed{243}$.", "pred": "We can start by listing out the possible values of $ab$ for $a,b \\in S$. Since $m \\ge 3$, the smallest possible value of $a$ is $3$ and the smallest possible value of $b$ is $4$. Thus, the smallest possible value of $ab$ is $3 \\cdot 4 = 12$. Similarly, the largest possible value of $a$ is $m-1$ and the largest possible value of $b$ is $m$. Thus, the largest possible value of $ab$ is $(m-1)(m) = m^2 - m$. \n\nNow, we want to find the smallest value of $m$ such that every integer from $12$ to $m^2 - m$ is in $S$. In other words, we want to find the smallest value of $m$ such that $12, 13, 14, \\ldots, m^2 - m$ are all in $S$. \n\nWe can start by finding the smallest value of $m$ such that $12$ is in $S$. Since $S$ starts at $3$, the smallest value of $m$ such that $12$ is in $S$ is $12$. \n\nNext, we want to find the smallest value of $m$ such that $13$ is in $S$. Since $13$ is not divisible by $3$, $4$, or $5$, the smallest value of $m$ such that $13$ is in $S$ is $13$. \n\nSimilarly, we can find the smallest value of $m$ such that $14$ is in $S$ is $14$, the smallest value of $m$ such that $15$ is in $S$ is $15$, and so on. \n\nFinally, we want to find the smallest value of $m$ such that $m^2 - m$ is in $S$. Since $m^2 - m$ is divisible by $m$, the smallest value of $m$ such that $m^2 - m$ is in $S$ is $m$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $m$ such that every integer from $12$ to $m^2 - m$ is in $S$ is $m = \\boxed{12}$."}

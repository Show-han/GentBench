{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For a positive integer $p$, define the positive integer $n$ to be $p$-safe if $n$ differs in absolute value by more than $2$ from all multiples of $p$. For example, the set of $10$-safe numbers is $\\{ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, \\ldots\\}$. Find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ which are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe.\n", "solution": "We see that a number $n$ is $p$-safe if and only if the residue of $n \\mod p$ is greater than $2$ and less than $p-2$; thus, there are $p-5$ residues $\\mod p$ that a $p$-safe number can have. Therefore, a number $n$ satisfying the conditions of the problem can have $2$ different residues $\\mod 7$, $6$ different residues $\\mod 11$, and $8$ different residues $\\mod 13$. The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that for a number $x$ that is $a$ (mod b) $c$ (mod d) $e$ (mod f) has one solution if $gcd(b,d,f)=1$. For example, in our case, the number $n$ can be: 3 (mod 7) 3 (mod 11) 7 (mod 13) so since $gcd(7,11,13)$=1, there is 1 solution for n for this case of residues of $n$.\nThis means that by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $n$ can have $2\\cdot 6 \\cdot 8 = 96$ different residues mod $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13 = 1001$. Thus, there are $960$ values of $n$ satisfying the conditions in the range $0 \\le n < 10010$. However, we must now remove any values greater than $10000$ that satisfy the conditions. By checking residues, we easily see that the only such values are $10006$ and $10007$, so there remain $\\boxed{958}$ values satisfying the conditions of the problem.", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe, we can use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nFirst, we find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are $7$-safe. We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are not multiples of $7$, and then subtracting the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are multiples of $7$ but not $7$-safe.\n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10000}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 1428$ multiples of $7$ less than or equal to $10,000$. However, we need to subtract the number of multiples of $7$ that are not $7$-safe. The multiples of $7$ that are not $7$-safe are $7$ less than a multiple of $7$, $7$ more than a multiple of $7$, and the multiples of $7$ themselves. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10000}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 1428$ multiples of $7$ less than or equal to $10,000$, so there are $1428 + 1428 + 1 = 2857$ multiples of $7$ that are not $7$-safe.\n\nTherefore, there are $10000 - 2857 = 7143$ positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are $7$-safe.\n\nSimilarly, there are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10000}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 909$ multiples of $11$ less than or equal to $10,000$, and $909 + 909 + 1 = 1819$ multiples of $11$ that are not $11$-safe.\n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{10000}{13} \\right\\rfloor = 769$ multiples of $13$ less than or equal to $10,000$, and $769 + 769 + 1 = 1539$ multiples of $13$ that are not $13$-safe.\n\nNow, we need to find the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe. We can do this by finding the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are not multiples of $7$, $11$, or $13$, and then subtracting the number of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are multiples of $7$ but not $7$-safe, multiples of $11$ but not $11$-safe, multiples of $13$ but not $13$-safe, and multiples of $7$ and $11$ but not $7$-safe and $11$-safe, and so on.\n\nUsing the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we have:\n\nNumber of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe $= 10000 - (2857 + 1819 + 1539) + (2 \\cdot 7 + 2 \\cdot 11 + 2 \\cdot 13) - (2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 + 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 13 + 2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13) + 2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\nEvaluating this expression, we get:\n\nNumber of positive integers less than or equal to $10,000$ that are simultaneously $7$-safe, $11$-safe, and $13$-safe $= 10000 - 6215 + 60 - 182 + 182 = \\boxed{6845}$."}

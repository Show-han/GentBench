{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.", "solution": "We first try a hundreds digit of $9$. Since the number is then divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits must be divisible by $9$, and so the sum of the remaining two digits must be divisible by $9$. If the tens digit is even (and non-zero), then the last digit must be the difference from $9$ of the tens digit and thus odd, but then the number is not divisible by the tens digit. Thus, the tens digit is odd. Trying the possibilities one by one, we see that $7 \\nmid 972, 5 \\nmid 954$, but $3$ and $6$ both divide into $\\boxed{936}$.", "pred": "To find the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the largest three-digit number, which is 999.\n2. Check if the number is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits.\n3. The distinct, non-zero digits in 999 are 9 and 9.\n4. Check if 999 is divisible by 9. It is divisible by 9 since the sum of its digits (9 + 9 + 9 = 27) is divisible by 9.\n5. Since 999 is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits, it is the largest three-digit integer that satisfies the given condition.\n\nTherefore, the largest three-digit integer that is divisible by each of its distinct, non-zero digits is 999."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $f(n)$ be the sum of all the divisors of a positive integer $n$. If $f(f(n)) = n+2$, then call $n$ superdeficient. How many superdeficient positive integers are there?", "solution": "For $n = 1,$ $f(1) = 1,$ so\n\\[f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1.\\]Thus, $n = 1$ does not satisfy $f(f(n)) = n + 2.$  Henceforth, assume that $n \\ge 2$.\n\nSince $1$ and $n$ always divide $n$, we have that $f(n) \\ge n+1$, so $f(f(n)) \\ge n+2$. Therefore, in order for $n$ to be superdeficient, $f(n) = n+1$ and $f(n+1) = n+2$. However, if $f(k) = k+1$, then $k$ must be prime. Therefore, we are searching for consecutive prime integers. However, one of those primes must necessarily be even, and the only even prime is $2$. Note that $f(2) = 3$ and $f(3) = 4$, so there is exactly $\\boxed{1}$ superdeficient number: $2$.", "pred": "Let's start by finding the divisors of $n$. We know that $f(n)$ is the sum of all the divisors of $n$, so $f(n)$ is a positive integer. \n\nNext, we find the divisors of $f(n)$. We know that $f(f(n)) = n+2$, so $f(f(n))$ is also a positive integer. \n\nSince $f(f(n)) = n+2$, we can conclude that $f(n) = n+2$. \n\nNow, let's consider the divisors of $n+2$. We know that $f(n) = n+2$, so the sum of the divisors of $n$ is equal to $n+2$. \n\nTo find the divisors of $n+2$, we can subtract $2$ from each divisor of $n$. \n\nFor example, if $n = 6$, then the divisors of $n$ are $1, 2, 3, 6$, and the sum of these divisors is $12$. \n\nSince $f(n) = n+2$, we have $f(6) = 6+2 = 8$. \n\nThe divisors of $8$ are $1, 2, 4, 8$, and if we subtract $2$ from each of these divisors, we get $-1, 0, 2, 6$. \n\nTherefore, $n = 6$ is not superdeficient. \n\nWe can repeat this process for other values of $n$ to determine if they are superdeficient. \n\nIn general, to find the divisors of $n+2$, we can subtract $2$ from each divisor of $n$. \n\nIf the sum of these divisors is equal to $n+2$, then $n$ is superdeficient. \n\nTo find the number of superdeficient positive integers, we need to check all positive integers $n$ and count the ones that are superdeficient. \n\nThis process can be time-consuming, so it may be helpful to use a computer program or mathematical software to assist with the calculations."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If $S$, $H$, and $E$ are all distinct non-zero digits less than $5$ and the following is true, find the sum of the three values $S$, $H$, and $E$, expressing your answer in base $5$. $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &S&H&E_5\\\\ &+&H&E_5\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &S&E&S_5\\\\ \\end{array}$$", "solution": "Starting with the the rightmost column would be the easiest (we'll call it the first, the second rightmost column the second, and so on). Let's consider the possible values for $E$ first.\n\nSince the values must be non-zero, we'll start with $1$. If $E$ is $1$, then $S$ would be $2$ and nothing would carry over. However, since $H+H$ must equal $E$ if nothing carries over and $H$ must be an integer, $E$ can not equal $1$.\n\nIf $E$ equals $2$, then $S$ must equal $4$. $H$ would then equal $1$. This satisfies our original equation as shown: $$\\begin{array}{c@{}c@{}c@{}c} &4&1&2_5\\\\ &+&1&2_5\\\\ \\cline{2-4} &4&2&4_5\\\\ \\end{array}$$Thus, $S+H+E=4+1+2=7$. In base $5$, the sum is then $\\boxed{12_5}$.\n\nNote: The other possible values for $E$ can also be checked. If $E$ equaled $3$, the residue $S$ would then equal $1$ and $1$ would be carried over. Since nothing carries over into the third column, $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $3$. However, $H$ can not equal $1$ because the digits must be distinct.\n\nIf $E$ equaled $4$, the residue $S$ would then equal $3$ and $1$ would be carried over. $1+H+H$ would then have to equal $4$, but $H$ can not be a decimal. Therefore, the above solution is the only possible one.", "pred": "Since $S$, $H$, and $E$ are all distinct non-zero digits less than $5$, we can list out the possible values for each digit: $S$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$; $H$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$; and $E$ can be $1$, $2$, $3$, or $4$. \n\nWe can start by considering the rightmost column, which represents the units digit. The sum of the units digits on the left side is $E$, so $E$ must be $S+H$ (expressed in base $5$). Since $S$ and $H$ are distinct digits less than $5$, their sum will be less than $10$, so $E$ will be a single digit in base $5$. \n\nNext, we consider the middle column, which represents the $5$'s digit. The sum of the $5$'s digits on the left side is $H$, so $H$ must be $S+E$ (expressed in base $5$). Again, since $S$ and $E$ are distinct digits less than $5$, their sum will be less than $10$, so $H$ will be a single digit in base $5$. \n\nFinally, we consider the leftmost column, which represents the $25$'s digit. The sum of the $25$'s digits on the left side is $S$, so $S$ must be $S$ (expressed in base $5$). This means that $S$ must be $0$ in base $5$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the three values $S$, $H$, and $E$ is $0+H+E$, which is $H+E$ (expressed in base $5$). Since $H$ and $E$ are both digits less than $5$, their sum will be less than $10$, so $H+E$ will be a single digit in base $5$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of the three values $S$, $H$, and $E$ is $\\boxed{H+E}$ (expressed in base $5$)."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 474 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminate?", "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 475 as $5^2\\cdot 19$, we see that $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 19. There are 24 multiples of 19 from 1 to 474, so there are $\\boxed{24}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{475}$ a terminating decimal.", "pred": "To determine if the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates, we need to check if $475$ is divisible by all the prime factors of $n$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $475$ is $5^2 \\cdot 19$. \n\nFor the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ to terminate, $n$ must be divisible by $5^2 \\cdot 19$. \n\nThe number of positive integers less than or equal to $474$ that are divisible by $5^2 \\cdot 19$ is equal to the number of positive integers less than or equal to $\\frac{474}{5^2 \\cdot 19}$. \n\nSimplifying, we have $\\frac{474}{5^2 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{474}{475} = 1$. \n\nTherefore, there is $\\boxed{1}$ integer value of $n$ between $1$ and $474$ inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{475}$ terminates."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The increasing sequence $1,3,4,9,10,12,13\\cdots$ consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers of 3. Find the $100^{\\mbox{th}}$ term of this sequence.\n", "solution": "Rewrite all of the terms in base 3. Since the numbers are sums of distinct powers of 3, in base 3 each number is a sequence of 1s and 0s (if there is a 2, then it is no longer the sum of distinct powers of 3). Therefore, we can recast this into base 2 (binary) in order to determine the 100th number. $100$ is equal to $64 + 32 + 4$, so in binary form we get $1100100$. However, we must change it back to base 10 for the answer, which is $3^6 + 3^5 + 3^2 = 729 + 243 + 9 = \\boxed{981}$.", "pred": "To find the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence, we can start by listing out the terms until we reach the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term.\n\n1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, ...\n\nWe can see that the sequence starts with the powers of 3: 1, 3, 9, 27, ...\n\nThen, we can see that the sequence includes the sums of distinct powers of 3. The first sum of distinct powers of 3 is $1+3=4$. The next sum is $1+9=10$. Then, we have $3+9=12$, $1+3+9=13$, and so on.\n\nWe can continue listing out the terms until we reach the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term. However, this process can be time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, we can find a pattern in the sequence. We can see that the powers of 3 are increasing by a factor of 3 each time: $3^0=1$, $3^1=3$, $3^2=9$, $3^3=27$, ...\n\nWe can also see that the sums of distinct powers of 3 are increasing by 1 each time: $1+3=4$, $1+9=10$, $3+9=12$, $1+3+9=13$, ...\n\nFrom this pattern, we can determine that the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is $3^{99}$.\n\nTherefore, the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of the sequence is $\\boxed{3^{99}}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $f(n)$ be a function that, given an integer $n$, returns an integer $k$, where $k$ is the smallest possible integer such that $k!$ is divisible by $n$. Given that $n$ is a multiple of 15, what is the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$?", "solution": "Let $n = 15r$. Clearly, $r>14$, because $15!$ contains 15 as a factor and all integers less than 15 as factors. If $r=15$, then $n=225$, However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3s$, so $r > 15$. If $r=16$, then $n=240$. However, $15! = 15 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 2t$, so $r > 16$. If $r=17$, then $n = 255$. Note that $f(255) = 17$ because the smallest integer $k$ such that $k!$ is divisible by 17 is $k = 17$, because 17 is prime. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 15 that fits the desired condition is $\\boxed{n = 255}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 15. \n\nStep 1: Find the prime factorization of 15. $15 = 3 \\cdot 5$.\n\nStep 2: Find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ is divisible by 15. Since 15 has both 3 and 5 as prime factors, we need to find the smallest value of $n$ such that $n!$ has at least one factor of 3 and one factor of 5.\n\nStep 3: The smallest value of $n$ that satisfies this condition is $n = 5$, because $5! = 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 120$, which is divisible by 15.\n\nStep 4: Check if $f(n) > 15$ for $n = 5$. $f(5) = 3$, which is not greater than 15.\n\nStep 5: Increment $n$ and repeat steps 2-4 until $f(n) > 15$.\n\nStep 6: The smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is $n = 6$. $6! = 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 720$, which is divisible by 15. $f(6) = 4$, which is greater than 15.\n\nTherefore, the smallest value of $n$ such that $f(n) > 15$ is $\\boxed{6}$."}

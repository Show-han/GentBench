{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: In any month with five Mondays, a school declares the fifth Monday a Marvelous Monday. School begins on Monday, September 4. What is the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts? (If you abbreviate, do not use a dot in the abbreviation.)", "solution": "September has 30 days.  September 4 is a Monday, so September 9 is a Saturday.  Since September 30 is exactly 21 days later (or 3 weeks), September 30 is also a Saturday.\n\nThen October 1 is a Sunday, and October 2 is a Monday.  Then October 2, 9, 16, 23, and 30 are all Mondays, so the first Marvelous Monday is $\\boxed{\\text{October 30}}$.", "pred": "To find the date of the first Marvelous Monday after school starts, we need to determine the number of Mondays that occur after September 4 until we reach the fifth Monday. \n\nStep 1: Count the number of days from September 4 until the first Monday. \nSeptember 4 is a Monday, so the first Monday is September 4 itself. \n\nStep 2: Count the number of days from the first Monday until the fifth Monday. \nSince there are 7 days in a week, we need to count 4 weeks and 4 days to reach the fifth Monday. \n4 weeks = 4 * 7 = 28 days\n4 days = 4\n\nStep 3: Add the number of days from step 1 and step 2 to September 4. \nSeptember 4 + 28 days + 4 days = September 4 + 32 days\n\nTherefore, the first Marvelous Monday after school starts is on October 6."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 349 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminate?", "solution": "Recall that the decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. Prime factorizing 350 as $2\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7$, we see that $n/350$ terminates if and only if $n$ is divisible by 7. There are 49 multiples of 7 from 1 to 349, so there are $\\boxed{49}$ possible values of $n$ that make $\\frac{n}{350}$ a terminating decimal.", "pred": "To determine if the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminates, we need to check if $350$ is divisible by the prime factors of $n$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $350$ is $2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. \n\nFor the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ to terminate, $n$ must be divisible by $2$, $5$, and $7$. \n\nWe can count the number of integers between $1$ and $349$ inclusive that are divisible by $2$, $5$, and $7$ by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{2} \\right\\rfloor = 174$ integers divisible by $2$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 69$ integers divisible by $5$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{7} \\right\\rfloor = 49$ integers divisible by $7$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nHowever, we have counted some integers twice. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{2 \\cdot 5} \\right\\rfloor = 34$ integers divisible by both $2$ and $5$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{2 \\cdot 7} \\right\\rfloor = 24$ integers divisible by both $2$ and $7$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nThere are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{5 \\cdot 7} \\right\\rfloor = 9$ integers divisible by both $5$ and $7$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nFinally, there are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{349}{2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7} \\right\\rfloor = 4$ integers divisible by $2$, $5$, and $7$ between $1$ and $349$. \n\nBy the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of integers between $1$ and $349$ inclusive that are divisible by $2$, $5$, and $7$ is $174 + 69 + 49 - 34 - 24 - 9 + 4 = 229$. \n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{229}$ integer values of $n$ between $1$ and $349$ inclusive for which the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{350}$ terminates."}

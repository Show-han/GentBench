{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Suppose $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes.\n\nIf $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, then $a$ has at most how many distinct prime factors?", "solution": "The prime factors of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are precisely the prime factors which are common to $a$ and $b$ (i.e., the primes that divide both). The prime factors of $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ are the primes which divide at least one of $a$ and $b$.\n\nThus, there are $7$ primes which divide both $a$ and $b$, and $28-7=21$ more primes which divide exactly one of $a$ and $b$. Since $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, we know that fewer than half of these $21$ primes divide $a$; at most, $10$ of these primes divide $a$. So, $a$ has at most $7+10=\\boxed{17}$ distinct prime factors.", "pred": "Let $p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_7$ be the $7$ distinct primes that divide $\\gcd(a,b)$, and let $q_1, q_2, \\dots, q_{28}$ be the $28$ distinct primes that divide $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$. Since $\\gcd(a,b)$ is divisible by exactly $7$ distinct primes, it must be of the form $p_1p_2 \\dotsm p_7$. Similarly, since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b]$ is divisible by exactly $28$ distinct primes, it must be of the form $q_1q_2 \\dotsm q_{28}$.\n\nSince $a$ has fewer distinct prime factors than $b$, it follows that $a$ must be of the form $p_1p_2 \\dotsm p_k$ for some $k \\leq 7$. Therefore, $a$ has at most $\\boxed{7}$ distinct prime factors."}

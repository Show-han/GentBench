{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: When the digits in the number $2005$ are reversed we obtain the number $5002,$ and $5002 = a \\cdot b \\cdot c$, such that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are three distinct primes. How many other positive integers are the products of exactly three distinct primes $p_1$, $p_2$ and $p_3$ such that $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = a+b+c$?", "solution": "5002 factors to $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$, which sums to 104.  Since 2 is the only even prime number, and we need the sum of these 3 distinct primes to be even, 2 must be one of these primes, meaning we need to look at pairs of primes that sum to 102.  We start with 3, subtract that from 102, and see if the resulting number is prime.  We need check only primes up to 51 in this manner because if the prime is greater than 51, its corresponding prime would be less than 51, meaning we would have found the pair already.  In this manner, we find the following 7 different pairs: $(5,97);(13,89);(19,83);(23,79);(29,73);(31,71);(43,59)$, and thus, there are $\\boxed{7 \\text{ distinct integers}}$.", "pred": "The prime factorization of $5002$ is $2 \\cdot 41 \\cdot 61$. Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are distinct primes, we must have $a = 2$, $b = 41$, and $c = 61$. Thus, $p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 2 + 41 + 61 = 104$. We want to find the number of positive integers that can be expressed as the product of three distinct primes whose sum is $104$. \n\nSince $104$ is even, one of the primes must be $2$. The other two primes must sum to $104 - 2 = 102$. The only way to express $102$ as the sum of two distinct primes is $101 + 1$. Therefore, the only other positive integer that can be expressed as the product of three distinct primes whose sum is $104$ is $2 \\cdot 101 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{202}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If $n = 2^{10} \\cdot 3^{14} \\cdot 5^{8}$, how many of the natural-number factors of $n$ are multiples of 150?", "solution": "$150=2^13^15^2$.  Thus the coefficient of $2$ must be between $1$ and $10$, the coefficient of $3$ must be between $1$ and $14$, and the coefficient of $5$ must be between $2$ and $8$.  So the number of possible factors is\n\n$$(10)(14)(7)=\\boxed{980}$$", "pred": "To find the number of natural-number factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150, we need to consider the prime factorization of 150. \n\nThe prime factorization of 150 is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. \n\nTo form a factor of $n$ that is a multiple of 150, we need to choose the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 in the factor such that they are at least as large as the corresponding exponents in the prime factorization of 150. \n\nFor the exponent of 2, we have 10 choices (0, 1, 2, ..., 10). \nFor the exponent of 3, we have 14 choices (0, 1, 2, ..., 14). \nFor the exponent of 5, we have 8 choices (0, 1, 2, ..., 8). \n\nTherefore, the total number of natural-number factors of $n$ that are multiples of 150 is $10 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 8 = \\boxed{1120}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the sum of all of the positive even factors of $504$?", "solution": "First, we find that the prime factorization of $504$ is $2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7$. Note that the even divisors of 504 are precisely the integers of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$. Note also that distributing $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)$ yields 18 terms, with each integer of the form $2^a3^b7^c$ (again, where $1\\leq a \\leq 3$, $0\\leq b\\leq 2$, and $0\\leq c \\leq 1$) appearing exactly once.  It follows that the sum of the even divisors of 504 is $(2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=\\boxed{1456}$.", "pred": "First, we prime factorize $504$ as $2^3\\cdot3^2\\cdot7$. The positive even factors of $504$ are of the form $2^a\\cdot3^b\\cdot7^c$, where $0\\leq a\\leq3$, $0\\leq b\\leq2$, and $0\\leq c\\leq1$. The sum of all such factors is equal to $(2^0+2^1+2^2+2^3)(3^0+3^1+3^2)(7^0+7^1)$. Evaluating this expression gives $(1+2+4+8)(1+3+9)(1+7)=15\\cdot13\\cdot8=\\boxed{1560}$."}

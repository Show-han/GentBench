{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Given that\n\\begin{eqnarray*}&(1)& x\\text{ and }y\\text{ are both integers between 100 and 999, inclusive;}\\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\\\     &(2)& y\\text{ is the number formed by reversing the digits of }x\\text{; and}\\\\     &(3)& z=|x-y|. \\end{eqnarray*}\nHow many distinct values of $z$ are possible?\n", "solution": "We express the numbers as $x=100a+10b+c$ and $y=100c+10b+a$. From this, we have\\begin{eqnarray*}z&=&|100a+10b+c-100c-10b-a|\\\\&=&|99a-99c|\\\\&=&99|a-c|\\\\ \\end{eqnarray*}Because $a$ and $c$ are digits, and $a$ and $c$ are both between 1 and 9 (from condition 1), there are $\\boxed{9}$ possible values (since all digits except $9$ can be expressed this way).", "pred": "To find the number of distinct values of $z$, we need to consider all possible values of $x$ and $y$ and calculate the corresponding values of $z$. \n\nStep 1: Determine the possible values of $x$ and $y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are both integers between 100 and 999 inclusive, the possible values for $x$ are 100, 101, 102, ..., 998, 999. The corresponding values for $y$ are obtained by reversing the digits of $x$. \n\nStep 2: Calculate the value of $z$ for each pair of $x$ and $y$. $z$ is defined as the absolute difference between $x$ and $y$, so $z = |x - y|$. \n\nStep 3: Count the number of distinct values of $z$. To do this, we can create a list of all the calculated values of $z$ and count the number of unique values in the list. \n\nNote: It is important to consider the absolute value of the difference between $x$ and $y$ because the problem statement specifies that $z$ is the absolute difference. This means that the order of $x$ and $y$ does not matter when calculating $z$."}

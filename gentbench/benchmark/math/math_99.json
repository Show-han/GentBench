{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}?$", "solution": "An integer that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is of the form $23n+1$.\n\nTherefore, we form the inequality $23n+1<-999$, and find the largest possible integer $n$. We get \\begin{align*}\n23n+1&<-999 \\\\\n23n&<-1000\\\\\nn&<-\\frac{1000}{23} \\approx -43.48.\n\\end{align*} The largest possible negative integer $n$ is $-44$. We plug it in for $n$ to get $23 \\cdot -44 +1 =\\boxed{-1011}$.", "pred": "We want to find the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}.$ Since $1$ is positive, we look for the largest four-digit positive integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}.$\n\nThe largest four-digit positive integer is $9999,$ so we want to find the largest multiple of $23$ that is less than or equal to $9999.$ Dividing $9999$ by $23,$ we find that $9999 = 434 \\cdot 23 + 17,$ so the largest multiple of $23$ that is less than or equal to $9999$ is $434 \\cdot 23 = 9976.$\n\nTherefore, the largest four-digit positive integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $9976,$ so the largest four-digit negative integer congruent to $1 \\pmod{23}$ is $\\boxed{-9976}.$"}

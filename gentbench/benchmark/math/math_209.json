{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The American Mathematics College is holding its orientation for incoming freshmen. The incoming freshman class contains fewer than $500$ people. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $23$, $22$ people are in the last column. When the freshmen are told to line up in columns of $21$, $14$ people are in the last column. How many people are in the incoming freshman class?", "solution": "If $n$ is the number of people in the incoming class, then $n$ yields a remainder of $14$ when divided by $21$. Since both 21 and 14 are divisible by 7, this means that $n$ is divisible by $7$. Define $k=n/7$, and note that $7k \\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Dividing by 7, we get $k\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. Multiplying by 7 again, we get $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{3}$, which implies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. So we are looking for a solution to the following system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 2 \\pmod{3},\\\\\nn&\\equiv 22 \\pmod{23}. \\\\\n\\end{align*} First, we look for a solution to the last two congruences. Checking numbers that are one less than a multiple of 23, we find that 68 satisfies $n\\equiv 2\\pmod{3}$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the integers $n$ which satisfy both of the last two congruences are precisely those that differ from 68 by a multiple of $3\\cdot 23=69$. Checking $68+69$, $68+2\\cdot 69$, etc. we find that $68 + 5\\cdot 69 = \\boxed{413}$ is the least positive solution to the last two congruences which is also divisible by 7. Note that, by the Chinese remainder theorem again, the solutions of the above system of three congruences are precisely the positive integers that differ from 413 by a multiple of $7\\cdot3\\cdot23=483,$ so 413 is indeed the only solution between 0 and 500.", "pred": "Let $n$ be the number of people in the incoming freshman class. We know that $n$ is congruent to $22$ modulo $23$ and congruent to $14$ modulo $21$. This means that $n\\equiv 22\\pmod{23}$ and $n\\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. We can write these congruences as a system of linear congruences: \\begin{align*}\nn&\\equiv 22\\pmod{23}, \\\\\nn&\\equiv 14\\pmod{21}.\n\\end{align*} We can solve this system using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since $23$ and $21$ are relatively prime, there exists a unique solution modulo $23\\cdot 21=483$. Let $n=483k+r$, where $0\\leq r<483$. Substituting this into the congruences, we get \\begin{align*}\n483k+r&\\equiv 22\\pmod{23}, \\\\\n483k+r&\\equiv 14\\pmod{21}.\n\\end{align*} The first congruence gives us $14k+r\\equiv 22\\pmod{23}$, and the second congruence gives us $9k+r\\equiv 14\\pmod{21}$. Subtracting these congruences, we get $5k\\equiv 8\\pmod{23}$. Multiplying both sides by $14$, we have $70k\\equiv 112\\pmod{23}$. Since $70\\equiv 1\\pmod{23}$, we have $k\\equiv 112\\pmod{23}$. Since $112\\equiv 18\\pmod{23}$, we have $k\\equiv 18\\pmod{23}$. Let $k=23m+18$, where $0\\leq m<21$. Substituting this into $n=483k+r$, we get $n=483(23m+18)+r=11109m+8742+r$. Since $0\\leq r<483$, we have $8742+r<9225$. Therefore, $n<11109m+9225$. Since $n$ is the number of people in the incoming freshman class and $n$ is an integer, we have $n\\leq 11108$. Since $n$ is congruent to $22$ modulo $23$, the possible values of $n$ are $22$, $45$, $68$, $\\ldots$, $11099$. Since $n$ is congruent to $14$ modulo $21$, the possible values of $n$ are $14$, $35$, $56$, $\\ldots$, $11094$. The only number in both lists is $\\boxed{518}$."}

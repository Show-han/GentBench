{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many of the divisors of $8!$ are larger than $7!$?", "solution": "Suppose that $d$ divides $8!$ and that $d>7!$.  Taking the reciprocal of both sides of $d>7!$ and multiplying by $8!$, we find $\\frac{8!}{d}<\\frac{8!}{7!}=8$.  There are 7 positive integers less than 8, and $d$ can be chosen so that $\\frac{8!}{d}$ takes on any of these values, since $\\frac{8!}{d}$ ranges over all the divisors of 8! as $d$ ranges over the divisors of $8!$.  Therefore, $\\boxed{7}$ divisors of 8! are greater than $7!$.", "pred": "First, we need to find the prime factorization of $8!$. We have $8! = 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$. \n\nNext, we need to find the divisors of $8!$. A divisor of $8!$ is any positive integer that divides $8!$ without leaving a remainder. \n\nTo find the number of divisors of $8!$, we can use the formula for the number of divisors of a positive integer. The number of divisors of $8!$ is equal to $(7+1)(2+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 8 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 96$. \n\nNow, we need to find the number of divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$. \n\nSince $7! = 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, any divisor of $8!$ that is larger than $7!$ must have at least one factor of $2$ that is greater than $2^4$, or at least one factor of $3$ that is greater than $3^2$, or at least one factor of $5$ that is greater than $5$, or at least one factor of $7$ that is greater than $7$. \n\nThe number of divisors of $8!$ that are larger than $7!$ is equal to the number of divisors of $8!$ that have at least one factor of $2$ that is greater than $2^4$, plus the number of divisors of $8!$ that have at least one factor of $3$ that is greater than $3^2$, plus the number of divisors of $8!$ that have at least one factor of $5$ that is greater than $5$, plus the number of divisors of $8!$ that have at least one factor of $7$ that is greater than $7$. \n\nTo find the number of divisors of $8!$ that have at least one factor of $2$ that is greater than $2^4$, we need to count the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^5$ or $2^6$ or $2^7$. \n\nThe number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^5$ is equal to the number of divisors of $8!$ divided by the number of divisors of $2^5$. The number of divisors of $2^5$ is equal to $5+1=6$. Therefore, the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^5$ is equal to $96/6=16$. \n\nSimilarly, the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^6$ is equal to the number of divisors of $8!$ divided by the number of divisors of $2^6$. The number of divisors of $2^6$ is equal to $6+1=7$. Therefore, the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^6$ is equal to $96/7=13\\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nFinally, the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^7$ is equal to the number of divisors of $8!$ divided by the number of divisors of $2^7$. The number of divisors of $2^7$ is equal to $7+1=8$. Therefore, the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^7$ is equal to $96/8=12$. \n\nAdding up the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of $2$ that is equal to $2^5$ or $2^6$ or $2^7$, we get $16+13\\frac{5}{7}+12=41\\frac{5}{7}$. \n\nSimilarly, we can find the number of divisors of $8!$ that have a factor of"}

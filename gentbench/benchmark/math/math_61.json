{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the value of $a$ that satisfies the equation $293_{a}+468_{a}=73B_{a}$, where $B_{a}=11_{10}$.", "solution": "In the rightmost column there is no carrying, so our base must be greater than 11. In the next column, we see that $9_{a}+6_{a}=13_{a}$. This tells us that $a$ goes into 15 once, leaving a remainder of 3. Therefore, $a=\\boxed{12}$.", "pred": "First, we need to convert $B_{a}$ to base $a$. Since $B_{a}=11_{10}$, we know that $B_{a}=1\\cdot a^{1}+1\\cdot a^{0}=a+1$. \n\nNext, we can rewrite the given equation as $293_{a}+468_{a}=73(a+1)_{a}$. \n\nTo simplify the equation, we can convert $293_{a}$ and $468_{a}$ to base 10. \n\n$293_{a}=2\\cdot a^{2}+9\\cdot a^{1}+3\\cdot a^{0}=2a^{2}+9a+3$\n\n$468_{a}=4\\cdot a^{2}+6\\cdot a^{1}+8\\cdot a^{0}=4a^{2}+6a+8$\n\nSubstituting these values back into the equation, we have $2a^{2}+9a+3+4a^{2}+6a+8=73(a+1)_{a}$. \n\nSimplifying further, we get $6a^{2}+15a+11=73(a+1)_{a}$. \n\nSince $B_{a}=11_{10}$, we know that $a+1=11$. \n\nSolving for $a$, we subtract 1 from both sides of the equation to get $a=11-1=\\boxed{10}$."}

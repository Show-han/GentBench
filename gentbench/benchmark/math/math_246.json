{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450~?$$", "solution": "We have $\\gcd(n,100) = \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]-450$. Since $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100]$ is a multiple of $100$, we infer that $\\gcd(n,100)$ is a multiple of $50$ but not of $100$. But $\\gcd(n,100)$ is also a divisor of $100$, so it can only be $50$.\n\nThis implies two conclusions: first, $n$ is a multiple of $50$ (but not of $100$); second, $$\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[n,100] = \\gcd(n,100)+450 = 50+450 = 500.$$In particular, $n$ is less than $500$, so we need only check the possibilities $n=50,150,250,350,450$. Of these, only $250$ satisfies our second conclusion, so $n=250$ is the unique solution -- and the sum of all solutions is thus $\\boxed{250}$.", "pred": "Let $d = \\gcd(n,100)$. Then we can write $n = da$ and $100 = db$ for some positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that $\\gcd(a,b) = 1$. The equation becomes $\\text{lcm}(da,db) = d + 450$. Since $\\text{lcm}(da,db) = dab$, we have $dab = d + 450$. Dividing both sides by $d$ gives $ab = 1 + \\frac{450}{d}$. Since $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, we must have $d$ dividing $450$. The positive divisors of $450$ are $1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 25, 30, 45, 50, 75, 90, 150, 225, 450$. For each divisor $d$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$ to find $n = dab$. Summing up all the possible values of $n$, we get \\[1\\cdot 450 + 2\\cdot 225 + 3\\cdot 150 + 5\\cdot 90 + 6\\cdot 75 + 9\\cdot 50 + 10\\cdot 45 + 15\\cdot 30 + 18\\cdot 25 + 25\\cdot 18 + 30\\cdot 15 + 45\\cdot 10 + 50\\cdot 9 + 75\\cdot 6 + 90\\cdot 5 + 150\\cdot 3 + 225\\cdot 2 + 450\\cdot 1 = \\boxed{10050}.\\]"}

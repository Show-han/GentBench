{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The director of a marching band wishes to place the members into a formation that includes all of them and has no unfilled positions. If they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. The director realizes that if he arranges the group in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. Find the maximum number of members this band can have.\n", "solution": "If $n > 14$ then $n^2 + 6n + 14 < n^2 + 7n < n^2 + 8n + 21$ and so $(n + 3)^2 + 5 < n(n + 7) < (n + 4)^2 + 5$. If $n$ is an integer there are no numbers which are 5 more than a perfect square strictly between $(n + 3)^2 + 5$ and $(n + 4)^2 + 5$. Thus, if the number of columns is $n$, the number of students is $n(n + 7)$ which must be 5 more than a perfect square, so $n \\leq 14$. In fact, when $n = 14$ we have $n(n + 7) = 14\\cdot 21 = 294 = 17^2 + 5$, so this number works and no larger number can. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{294}$.", "pred": "Let's assume the number of members in the marching band is x.\n\nIf they are arranged in a square formation, there are 5 members left over. This means that x is 5 more than a perfect square number.\n\nSo, x = n^2 + 5, where n is a positive integer.\n\nIf they are arranged in a formation with 7 more rows than columns, there are no members left over. This means that x is a multiple of (n+7).\n\nSo, x = k(n+7), where k is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting the value of x from the first equation into the second equation, we get:\n\nn^2 + 5 = k(n+7)\n\nExpanding and rearranging the equation, we get:\n\nn^2 - kn + (7k - 5) = 0\n\nFor this equation to have integer solutions for n, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) must be a perfect square.\n\nThe discriminant is k^2 - 4(7k - 5) = k^2 - 28k + 20\n\nTo find the maximum number of members, we need to find the maximum value of k such that the discriminant is a perfect square.\n\nBy trial and error, we find that k = 14 satisfies this condition, as the discriminant becomes a perfect square (36).\n\nSo, substituting k = 14 into the equation x = k(n+7), we get:\n\nx = 14(n+7)\n\nThe maximum value of n is 13, as n cannot be greater than 13 for the discriminant to be a perfect square.\n\nSubstituting n = 13 into the equation x = 14(n+7), we get:\n\nx = 14(13+7) = 14(20) = 280\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of members this band can have is 280."}

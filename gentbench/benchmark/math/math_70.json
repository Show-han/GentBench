{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The positive integers $N$ and $N^2$ both end in the same sequence of four digits $abcd$ when written in base $10$, where digit a is not zero. Find the three-digit number $abc$.\n", "solution": "We have that $N^2 - N = N(N - 1)\\equiv 0\\mod{10000}$\nThus, $N(N-1)$ must be divisible by both $5^4$ and $2^4$. Note, however, that if either $N$ or $N-1$ has both a $5$ and a $2$ in its factorization, the other must end in either $1$ or $9$, which is impossible for a number that is divisible by either $2$ or $5$. Thus, one of them is divisible by $2^4 = 16$, and the other is divisible by $5^4 = 625$. Noting that $625 \\equiv 1\\mod{16}$, we see that $625$ would work for $N$, except the thousands digit is $0$. The other possibility is that $N$ is a multiple of $16$ and $N-1$ is a multiple of $625$. In order for this to happen,\\[N-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod {16}.\\]Since $625 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{16}$, we know that $15 \\cdot 625 = 9375 \\equiv 15 \\equiv -1 \\mod{16}$. Thus, $N-1 = 9375$, so $N = 9376$, and our answer is $\\boxed{937}$.", "pred": "Since $N$ and $N^2$ have the same last four digits, we know that $N^2 \\equiv N \\pmod{10000}$. This means that $N^2 - N$ is divisible by $10000$. Factoring out $N$ from the left side gives $N(N-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$. Since $N$ and $N-1$ are relatively prime, one of them must be divisible by $10000$. However, since $N$ is a positive integer, $N-1$ cannot be divisible by $10000$. Therefore, $N$ must be divisible by $10000$. This means that $N$ must have at least four digits. Since $N^2$ has four digits, $N$ must have exactly four digits. Let $N = 10000a + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Substituting this into the equation $N(N-1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$ gives $(10000a + b)(10000a + b - 1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$. Expanding the left side gives $100000000a^2 + 20000ab + b^2 - 10000a - b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$. Since $100000000a^2 + 20000ab + b^2 - 10000a - b$ is divisible by $10000$, the last four digits of $100000000a^2 + 20000ab + b^2 - 10000a - b$ must be $0000$. Therefore, $-10000a - b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$. This means that $10000a + b \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10000}$. Since $10000a + b$ is a four-digit number, $10000a + b = 10000$. Solving this equation gives $a = 1$ and $b = 0$. Therefore, $N = 10000a + b = \\boxed{10000}$."}

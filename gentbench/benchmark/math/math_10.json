{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For positive integers $n,$ let $\\tau (n)$ denote the number of positive integer divisors of $n,$ including 1 and $n.$ For example, $\\tau (1)=1$ and $\\tau(6) =4.$ Define $S(n)$ by $S(n)=\\tau(1)+ \\tau(2) + \\cdots + \\tau(n).$ Let $a$ denote the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ odd, and let $b$ denote the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ even. Find $|a-b|.$\n", "solution": "It is well-known that $\\tau(n)$ is odd if and only if $n$ is a perfect square. (Otherwise, we can group divisors into pairs whose product is $n$.) Thus, $S(n)$ is odd if and only if there are an odd number of perfect squares less than $n$. So $S(1), S(2)$ and $S(3)$ are odd, while $S(4), S(5), \\ldots, S(8)$ are even, and $S(9), \\ldots, S(15)$ are odd, and so on.\nSo, for a given $n$, if we choose the positive integer $m$ such that $m^2 \\leq n < (m + 1)^2$ we see that $S(n)$ has the same parity as $m$.\nIt follows that the numbers between $1^2$ and $2^2$, between $3^2$ and $4^2$, and so on, all the way up to the numbers between $43^2$ and $44^2 = 1936$ have $S(n)$ odd. These are the only such numbers less than $2005$ (because $45^2 = 2025 > 2005$).\nNotice that the difference between consecutive squares are consecutively increasing odd numbers. Thus, there are $3$ numbers between $1$ (inclusive) and $4$ (exclusive), $5$ numbers between $4$ and $9$, and so on. The number of numbers from $n^2$ to $(n + 1)^2$ is $(n + 1 - n)(n + 1 + n) = 2n + 1$. Whenever the lowest square beneath a number is odd, the parity will be odd, and the same for even. Thus, $a = [2(1) + 1] + [2(3) + 1] \\ldots [2(43) + 1] = 3 + 7 + 11 \\ldots 87$. $b = [2(2) + 1] + [2(4) + 1] \\ldots [2(42) + 1] + 70 = 5 + 9 \\ldots 85 + 70$, the $70$ accounting for the difference between $2005$ and $44^2 = 1936$, inclusive. Notice that if we align the two and subtract, we get that each difference is equal to $2$. Thus, the solution is $|a - b| = |b - a| = |2 \\cdot 21 + 70 - 87| = \\boxed{25}$.", "pred": "First, we can notice that if $n$ is a perfect square, then $\\tau(n)$ is odd. This is because if $n = k^2$, then the divisors of $n$ are $1, k, k^2$, which is an odd number of divisors. Therefore, if $n$ is a perfect square, then $S(n)$ is odd.\nNext, we can notice that if $n$ is not a perfect square, then $\\tau(n)$ is even. This is because if $n$ is not a perfect square, then it can be factored into two distinct prime factors, say $p$ and $q$. Then, the divisors of $n$ are $1, p, q, n$, which is an even number of divisors. Therefore, if $n$ is not a perfect square, then $S(n)$ is even.\nNow, we can count the number of perfect squares less than or equal to $2005$. The largest perfect square less than or equal to $2005$ is $44^2 = 1936$. Therefore, there are $44$ perfect squares less than or equal to $2005$.\nSince there are $2005$ positive integers less than or equal to $2005$, and $44$ of them are perfect squares, the remaining $2005 - 44 = 1961$ positive integers are not perfect squares.\nOut of these $1961$ positive integers, we know that $S(n)$ is even for all of them. Therefore, there are $1961$ positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ even.\nFinally, we can calculate $a - b$. Since $a$ is the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ odd, and $b$ is the number of positive integers $n \\leq 2005$ with $S(n)$ even, we have $a - b = 0 - 1961 = \\boxed{-1961}$."}

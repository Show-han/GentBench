{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the largest number, with its digits all different, whose digits add up to 16?", "solution": "For a number to be as large as possible, we want as many places (digits) as possible. To allow for as many digits as possible, we want the digits to be small so that there will be more digits that add up to $16$. We start with the smallest number, $0$ and keep adding the next number. $0+1+2+3+4=10$. However, we cannot add $5$, because then we are left with $16-10-5=1$, and we already have the number $1$. Therefore, the next number to be added would be $16-10=6$.\nNow, we have the numbers $0,1,2,3,4,6$ to form a number. We want the larger places to have larger numbers. Therefore, we order the numbers in decreasing order to form the number $\\boxed{643210}$.", "pred": "To find the largest number with different digits that add up to 16, we can start with the largest digit, which is 9. \n\n1. Place 9 as the first digit.\n2. Subtract 9 from 16, which leaves us with 7.\n3. The next largest digit is 7, so place it as the second digit.\n4. Subtract 7 from 7, which leaves us with 0.\n5. The only remaining digit is 0, so place it as the third digit.\n\nTherefore, the largest number with different digits that add up to 16 is 970."}

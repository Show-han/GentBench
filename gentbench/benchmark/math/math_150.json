{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A solid rectangular block is formed by gluing together $N$ congruent 1-cm cubes face to face. When the block is viewed so that three of its faces are visible, exactly $231$ of the 1-cm cubes cannot be seen. Find the smallest possible value of $N.$\n", "solution": "The $231$ cubes which are not visible must lie below exactly one layer of cubes. Thus, they form a rectangular solid which is one unit shorter in each dimension. If the original block has dimensions $l \\times m \\times n$, we must have $(l - 1)\\times(m-1) \\times(n - 1) = 231$. The prime factorization of $231 = 3\\cdot7\\cdot11$, so we have a variety of possibilities; for instance, $l - 1 = 1$ and $m - 1 = 11$ and $n - 1 = 3 \\cdot 7$, among others. However, it should be fairly clear that the way to minimize $l\\cdot m\\cdot n$ is to make $l$ and $m$ and $n$ as close together as possible, which occurs when the smaller block is $3 \\times 7 \\times 11$. Then the extra layer makes the entire block $4\\times8\\times12$, and $N= \\boxed{384}$.", "pred": "Let the dimensions of the block be $a \\times b \\times c$. Then the number of cubes that can be seen is $2(ab+bc+ca)-4(a+b+c)+8$. We can prove this by considering the number of cubes that cannot be seen on each face.\nWe are given that $2(ab+bc+ca)-4(a+b+c)+8=abc-231$. Rearranging, we have $abc-2ab-2bc-2ca+4a+4b+4c=239$. Factoring the left side, we have $(a-2)(b-2)(c-2)=239$. Since $239$ is prime, we have $a-2=1$, $b-2=1$, and $c-2=239$, or $a-2=1$, $b-2=239$, and $c-2=1$, or $a-2=239$, $b-2=1$, and $c-2=1$. The smallest possible value of $N$ is $abc=3 \\cdot 241 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{2163}$."}

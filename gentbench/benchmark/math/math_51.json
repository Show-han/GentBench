{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$?", "solution": "An integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{55}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,55)=1$. Similarly, an integer $a$ has an inverse $\\pmod{66}$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,66)=1$.\n\nSince we're looking for an integer that doesn't have an inverse modulo either $55$ or $66$, we want $a$ such that $\\gcd(a,55)>1$ and $\\gcd(a,66)>1$. Thus $a$ must be divisible by either $5$ or $11$, and $a$ must also be divisible by either $2$, $3$, or $11$. The smallest positive integer that satisfies both properties is $\\boxed{10}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer $a$ such that $a^{-1}$ is undefined $\\pmod{55}$ and $a^{-1}$ is also undefined $\\pmod{66}$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $a$ that is not relatively prime to both $55$ and $66$.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $55$ and $66$:\n$$55 = 5 \\cdot 11$$\n$$66 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 11$$\n\nTo be relatively prime to $55$, $a$ cannot have a factor of $5$ or $11$. To be relatively prime to $66$, $a$ cannot have a factor of $2$, $3$, or $11$.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $a$ that satisfies both conditions is $a = \\boxed{22}$."}

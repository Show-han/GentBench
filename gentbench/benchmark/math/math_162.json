{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the largest integer $n$ satisfying the following conditions:\n(i) $n^2$ can be expressed as the difference of two consecutive cubes;\n(ii) $2n + 79$ is a perfect square.\n", "solution": "Write $n^2 = (m + 1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1$, or equivalently, $(2n + 1)(2n - 1) = 4n^2 - 1 = 12m^2 + 12m + 3 = 3(2m + 1)^2$.\nSince $2n + 1$ and $2n - 1$ are both odd and their difference is $2$, they are relatively prime. But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have $2n - 1$ be three times a square, for then $2n + 1$ would be a square congruent to $2$ modulo $3$, which is impossible.\nThus $2n - 1$ is a square, say $b^2$. But $2n + 79$ is also a square, say $a^2$. Then $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80$. Since $a + b$ and $a - b$ have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize $n$, it suffices to maximize $2b = (a + b) - (a - b)$ and check that this yields an integral value for $m$. This occurs when $a + b = 40$ and $a - b = 2$, that is, when $a = 21$ and $b = 19$. This yields $n = 181$ and $m = 104$, so the answer is $\\boxed{181}$.", "pred": "Let's start by considering condition (i). We want to find an integer $n$ such that $n^2$ can be expressed as the difference of two consecutive cubes. \n\nThe difference of two consecutive cubes can be written as $(n+1)^3 - n^3$. Expanding this expression, we have $(n+1)^3 - n^3 = n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n + 1 - n^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$. \n\nSo, we want to find an integer $n$ such that $n^2 = 3n^2 + 3n + 1$. Rearranging this equation, we have $2n^2 + 3n + 1 = 0$. \n\nTo solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula: $n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Plugging in the values $a = 2$, $b = 3$, and $c = 1$, we have $n = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(2)(1)}}{2(2)} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{4}$. \n\nSince we are looking for an integer solution, we can ignore the $\\pm$ and take the positive square root. So, $n = \\frac{-3 + 1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2}$. However, $n$ must be an integer, so $n = -\\frac{1}{2}$ does not satisfy condition (i). \n\nNow, let's consider condition (ii). We want to find an integer $n$ such that $2n + 79$ is a perfect square. \n\nLet's write $2n + 79$ as $k^2$, where $k$ is an integer. Rearranging this equation, we have $2n = k^2 - 79$. \n\nSince $k^2 - 79$ is an odd number (since $79$ is odd), $2n$ must also be an odd number. This means that $n$ must be an odd number. \n\nLet's try some values of $n$ to see if we can find a solution. If $n = 1$, then $2n + 79 = 2(1) + 79 = 81$, which is a perfect square. If $n = 3$, then $2n + 79 = 2(3) + 79 = 85$, which is not a perfect square. \n\nSo, the largest integer $n$ satisfying condition (ii) is $n = 1$. \n\nTo summarize, the largest integer $n$ satisfying the given conditions is $n = 1$."}

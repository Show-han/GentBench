{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Two farmers agree that pigs are worth $\\$300$ and that goats are worth $\\$210$. When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way?", "solution": "If a debt of $D$ dollars can be resolved in this way, then integers $p$ and $g$ must exist with \\[\nD = 300p + 210g = 30(10p + 7g).\n\\]As a consequence, $D$ must be a multiple of 30, and  no positive debt less than $\\$30$ can be resolved. A debt of  $\\boxed{\\$30}$  can be resolved since \\[\n30 = 300(-2) + 210(3).\n\\]This is  done by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs.", "pred": "Let's consider the value of the debt in terms of pigs and goats. We want to find the smallest positive debt that can be resolved, so we want to find the smallest positive value that can be expressed as $300x - 210y$, where $x$ and $y$ are non-negative integers.\n\nWe can rewrite this expression as $30(10x - 7y)$. Since $10x - 7y$ is an integer, we want to find the smallest positive value of $10x - 7y$.\n\nWe can start by trying different values of $x$ and $y$ to see if we can find a positive value for $10x - 7y$. If we let $x = 1$ and $y = 1$, we get $10(1) - 7(1) = 3$, which is positive. Therefore, the smallest positive value of $10x - 7y$ is $3$.\n\nSince $10x - 7y = 3$, we can multiply both sides by $30$ to get $300x - 210y = 90$. Therefore, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way is $\\boxed{90}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the least whole number that is divisible by 7, but leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by any integer 2 through 6?", "solution": "If $n$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, then $n-1$ is divisible by all of those integers. In other words, $n-1$ is a multiple of the least common multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Prime factorizing 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, we find that their least common multiple is $2^2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5=60$. Thus the possible values for an integer $n$ which is one more than a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are 61, 121, 181, 241, 301 and so on. Checking them one at a time, we find that the least of these integers which is divisible by 7 is $\\boxed{301}$.", "pred": "To find the least whole number that satisfies these conditions, we can start by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers 2 through 6. \n\nThe LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 is 60. \n\nNow, we need to find a number that is divisible by 7 and leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 60. \n\nWe can start by checking multiples of 60 until we find one that satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe first multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 420. \n\nChecking if 420 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n420 \u00f7 2 = 210 (remainder 0)\n420 \u00f7 3 = 140 (remainder 0)\n420 \u00f7 4 = 105 (remainder 0)\n420 \u00f7 5 = 84 (remainder 0)\n420 \u00f7 6 = 70 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 420 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by all the integers 2 through 6, it does not satisfy the given condition. \n\nWe need to find the next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7. \n\nThe next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 420 + 60 = 480. \n\nChecking if 480 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n480 \u00f7 2 = 240 (remainder 0)\n480 \u00f7 3 = 160 (remainder 0)\n480 \u00f7 4 = 120 (remainder 0)\n480 \u00f7 5 = 96 (remainder 0)\n480 \u00f7 6 = 80 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 480 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by all the integers 2 through 6, it does not satisfy the given condition. \n\nWe continue this process until we find the least whole number that satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 480 + 60 = 540. \n\nChecking if 540 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n540 \u00f7 2 = 270 (remainder 0)\n540 \u00f7 3 = 180 (remainder 0)\n540 \u00f7 4 = 135 (remainder 0)\n540 \u00f7 5 = 108 (remainder 0)\n540 \u00f7 6 = 90 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 540 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by all the integers 2 through 6, it does not satisfy the given condition. \n\nWe continue this process until we find the least whole number that satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 540 + 60 = 600. \n\nChecking if 600 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n600 \u00f7 2 = 300 (remainder 0)\n600 \u00f7 3 = 200 (remainder 0)\n600 \u00f7 4 = 150 (remainder 0)\n600 \u00f7 5 = 120 (remainder 0)\n600 \u00f7 6 = 100 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 600 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by all the integers 2 through 6, it does not satisfy the given condition. \n\nWe continue this process until we find the least whole number that satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 600 + 60 = 660. \n\nChecking if 660 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n660 \u00f7 2 = 330 (remainder 0)\n660 \u00f7 3 = 220 (remainder 0)\n660 \u00f7 4 = 165 (remainder 0)\n660 \u00f7 5 = 132 (remainder 0)\n660 \u00f7 6 = 110 (remainder 0)\n\nSince 660 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by all the integers 2 through 6, it does not satisfy the given condition. \n\nWe continue this process until we find the least whole number that satisfies both conditions. \n\nThe next multiple of 60 that is divisible by 7 is 660 + 60 = 720. \n\nChecking if 720 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6: \n\n720 \u00f7 2 = 360 (remainder 0)\n720 \u00f7 3 = 240 ("}

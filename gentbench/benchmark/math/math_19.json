{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many of the 343 smallest positive integers written in base 7 use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit?", "solution": "$343 = 7^3 = 1000_7$, so the first 343 natural numbers in base 7 are $1_7, 2_7, \\ldots 1000_7$.  Any number in this list that neither includes 4 or 5 only includes the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6.  If we replace 6 with 4, these have the same decimal expansions as the integers in base 5.  Since there are $5^3 = 125$ positive integers less than or equal to $1000_5$, there are 125 integers less than or equal to $1000_7$ that contain no 4's or 5's in base 7, which means there are $343 - 125 = \\boxed{218}$ integers that include a 4 or a 5.", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers written in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit among the 343 smallest positive integers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Determine the range of the 343 smallest positive integers in base 7. In base 7, the smallest positive integer is represented as 1, and the largest positive integer with three digits is represented as 666. Therefore, the range is from 1 to 666.\n\n2. Convert each number in the range from base 10 to base 7.\n\n3. Count the number of numbers in base 7 that contain 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit.\n\n4. Sum up the count from step 3 to find the total number of positive integers written in base 7 that use 4 or 5 (or both) as a digit among the 343 smallest positive integers."}

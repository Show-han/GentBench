{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many four-digit numbers whose digits add up to $9$ are divisible by $11$?", "solution": "For a number $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ to be divisible by $11$, we need $(a+c)-(b+d)$ to be divisible by $11$. If the digits of $\\underline{a}\\underline{b}\\underline{c}\\underline{d}$ add up to $9$, then $(a+c)-(b+d)$ must be $0$, because $(a+c)-(b+d)$ cannot be as large as 11 or as small as $-11$ without having $a+c+b+d\\geq 11$.\n\nNow $(a+c)-(b+d)=0$ implies that $a+c=b+d$, which in turn implies that $a+c$ and $b+d$ have the same parity (that is, they are either both odd or both even). Therefore, $a+b+c+d = (a+c)+(b+d)$ is even and therefore cannot be equal to $9$. So there are $\\boxed{0}$ possible numbers.", "pred": "To determine if a number is divisible by $11$, we can use the divisibility rule for $11$, which states that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be divisible by $11$. \n\nSince we are looking for four-digit numbers whose digits add up to $9$, we can start by listing the possible combinations of digits that add up to $9$:\n\n$9, 0, 0, 0$\n$8, 1, 0, 0$\n$7, 2, 0, 0$\n$7, 1, 1, 0$\n$6, 3, 0, 0$\n$6, 2, 1, 0$\n$6, 1, 1, 1$\n$5, 4, 0, 0$\n$5, 3, 1, 0$\n$5, 2, 2, 0$\n$5, 2, 1, 1$\n$4, 4, 1, 0$\n$4, 3, 2, 0$\n$4, 3, 1, 1$\n$4, 2, 2, 1$\n$3, 3, 3, 0$\n$3, 3, 2, 1$\n$3, 2, 2, 2$\n\nNow, we can check if each combination of digits satisfies the divisibility rule for $11$. \n\nFor example, for the combination $9, 0, 0, 0$, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions ($9$) and the sum of the digits in the even positions ($0+0+0$) is $9$. Since $9$ is divisible by $11$, this combination satisfies the divisibility rule for $11$.\n\nContinuing this process for each combination, we find that the following combinations satisfy the divisibility rule for $11$:\n\n$9, 0, 0, 0$\n$7, 1, 1, 0$\n$5, 2, 2, 0$\n$3, 3, 3, 0$\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{4}$ four-digit numbers whose digits add up to $9$ and are divisible by $11$."}

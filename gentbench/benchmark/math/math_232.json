{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many values of $k$ is $12^{12}$ the least common multiple of the positive integers $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$?\n", "solution": "It is evident that $k$ has only 2s and 3s in its prime factorization, or $k = 2^a3^b$.\n$6^6 = 2^6\\cdot3^6$\n$8^8 = 2^{24}$\n$12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12}$\nThe LCM of any numbers an be found by writing out their factorizations and taking the greatest power for each factor. $[6^6,8^8] = 2^{24}3^6$. Therefore $12^{12} = 2^{24}\\cdot3^{12} = [2^{24}3^6,2^a3^b] = 2^{\\max(24,a)}3^{\\max(6,b)}$, and $b = 12$. Since $0 \\le a \\le 24$, there are $\\boxed{25}$ values of $k$.", "pred": "First, we prime factorize $6^6$ and $8^8$. We have $6^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 3^6$ and $8^8 = 2^{24}$. \n\nTo find the least common multiple (LCM) of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$, we need to find the highest power of each prime that appears in the prime factorization of each number. \n\nFor $6^6$, the highest power of 2 is 6 and the highest power of 3 is 6. \n\nFor $8^8$, the highest power of 2 is 24 and there is no power of 3. \n\nTherefore, the LCM of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$ must have a power of 2 that is at least 24 and a power of 3 that is at least 6. \n\nSince $12^{12} = 2^{24} \\cdot 3^{12}$, we see that $12^{12}$ is the LCM of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$ if and only if $k$ is a positive integer that has a power of 2 that is at least 24 and a power of 3 that is at least 12. \n\nTherefore, there is $\\boxed{1}$ value of $k$ for which $12^{12}$ is the LCM of $6^6$, $8^8$, and $k$, namely $k = 2^{24} \\cdot 3^{12}$."}

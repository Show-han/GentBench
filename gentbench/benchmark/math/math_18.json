{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: If $A,B$ and $C$ are non-zero distinct digits in base $6$ such that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = \\overline{AAA0}_6$, find $B+C$ in base $6$.", "solution": "By definition of a base, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 = 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot B + C$. Noting that every digit appears in every possible slot once, it follows that $\\overline{ABC}_6 + \\overline{BCA}_6+ \\overline{CAB}_6 = (6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C).$ The value is equal to the sum, $\\overline{AAA0}_6 = 6^3 \\cdot A + 6^2 \\cdot A + 6 \\cdot A = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A)$. Setting them equal, $$(6^2 + 6 + 1)(A + B + C) = (6^2 + 6 + 1) \\cdot (6 \\cdot A) \\Longrightarrow B+C = 5 \\cdot A.$$Since $B,C < 6$, then $B+C < 2 \\cdot 6$, so $A = 1,2$. However, there do not exist distinct base $6$ digits such that $B + C = 2 \\cdot 5$, so it follows that $A = 1_6$, and $B+C = \\boxed{5}_6$.", "pred": "First, we can rewrite the given equation as $121A_6 + 20B_6 + 2C_6 = 216A_6$. Simplifying, we have $95A_6 + 20B_6 + 2C_6 = 0$. Since $A, B, C$ are distinct digits in base $6$, we know that $A, B, C \\le 5$. Therefore, $95A_6 + 20B_6 + 2C_6 \\le 95 \\cdot 5 + 20 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 525 + 100 + 10 = 635$. However, since this sum is equal to $0$ in base $6$, we must have $95A_6 + 20B_6 + 2C_6 = 0$. The only way this is possible is if $A = 0$, $B = 0$, and $C = 0$. However, the problem states that $A, B, C$ are non-zero digits, so there are no solutions. Therefore, there is no value for $B + C$ in base $6$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A book has 136 pages. Each page has the same number of words, and each page has no more than 100 words on it. The number of words in the book is congruent to 184, modulo 203. How many words are on each page?", "solution": "If there are $p$ words on each page, then we are given $136p \\equiv 184 \\pmod{203}$. We can divide both sides of the congruence by 8 since 8 is relatively prime to 203, and this yields $17p \\equiv 23 \\pmod{203}$. Checking integers which are 1 more than multiples of 203, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12. Therefore, $p \\equiv 12(23) \\equiv 73 \\pmod{203}$. Therefore, each page has $\\boxed{73}$ words on it.", "pred": "Let's assume that there are x words on each page.\nSince there are 136 pages, the total number of words in the book is 136x.\nWe are given that the number of words in the book is congruent to 184 modulo 203.\nThis means that 136x \u2261 184 (mod 203).\nTo find x, we need to solve this congruence equation.\nWe can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 8 (the greatest common divisor of 136 and 203) to get 17x \u2261 23 (mod 203).\nNow, we need to find the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203.\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the modular inverse of 17 modulo 203 is 12.\nMultiplying both sides of the congruence equation by 12, we get 12 * 17x \u2261 12 * 23 (mod 203).\nSimplifying, we have 204x \u2261 276 (mod 203).\nSince 204 is congruent to 1 modulo 203, we can simplify further to x \u2261 276 (mod 203).\nTo find the smallest positive solution for x, we can add multiples of 203 to 276 until we get a positive number.\nAdding 203 to 276, we get 479, which is positive.\nTherefore, x = 479 is the number of words on each page."}

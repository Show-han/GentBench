{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $S = \\{5^k | k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, 0 \\le k \\le 2004 \\}$. Given that $5^{2004} = 5443 \\cdots 0625$ has $1401$ digits, how many elements of $S$ begin with the digit $1$?\n", "solution": "Note that $5^n$ has the same number of digits as $5^{n-1}$ if and only if $5^{n-1}$ has a leading digit $1$. Therefore, there are $2004 - 1401 = 603$ numbers with leading digit $1$ among the set $\\{5^1, 5^2, 5^3, \\cdots 5^{2003}\\}.$ However, $5^0$ also starts with $1$, so the answer is $603 + 1 = \\boxed{604}$.", "pred": "To find the number of elements in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$, we need to determine the range of values of $k$ such that $5^k$ begins with the digit $1$. \n\nSince $5^{2004}$ has $1401$ digits, we know that $5^{2004}$ is greater than $10^{1400}$ but less than $10^{1401}$. \n\nTo find the range of values of $k$, we can take the logarithm base $10$ of both sides of the inequality $10^{1400} < 5^{2004} < 10^{1401}$. \n\nThis gives us $1400 < 2004 \\log_{10} 5 < 1401$. \n\nDividing all sides of the inequality by $2004$ gives us $0.698 < \\log_{10} 5 < 0.699$. \n\nSince $\\log_{10} 5$ is between $0.698$ and $0.699$, we know that $5^k$ begins with the digit $1$ when $k$ is between $0.698 \\cdot 2004$ and $0.699 \\cdot 2004$. \n\nTherefore, the number of elements in $S$ that begin with the digit $1$ is $0.699 \\cdot 2004 - 0.698 \\cdot 2004 + 1 = \\boxed{1402}$."}

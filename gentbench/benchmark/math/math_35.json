{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many positive integers $n$ does $\\frac{1}{n}$ yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit?", "solution": "Note that the numbers whose decimal representations begin $0.00\\ldots$ are the positive real numbers less than $1/100$. Therefore, the hundredths digit of $1/n$ is zero for all $n > 100$. Also, recall that $1/n$ is a terminating decimal if and only if $n$ is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The fifteen integers up to 100 whose prime factorizations contain only twos and fives are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 32, 40, 50, 64, 80, and 100. One way to generate this list systematically is to consider integers of the form $2^m5^n$, starting with $n=0$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4,5,6$, then $n=1$ and $m=0,1,2,3,4$, etc. Not all of these 15 integers have nonzero hundredths digits, however. For $n\\leq 10$, it is possible that the tenths digit is nonzero while the hundredths digit is zero. Checking the values of $n$ up to 10, we find that the hundredths digits of 1, 1/2, 1/5, and 1/10 are zero. Therefore, there are $15 - 4 = \\boxed{11}$ fractions that yield terminating decimals with a nonzero digit two places to the right of the decimal point.", "pred": "For $\\frac{1}{n}$ to yield a terminating decimal, $n$ must be a power of $10$ or a product of powers of $2$ and $5$. \n\nIf $n$ is a power of $10$, then it has the form $10^k$ for some positive integer $k$. In this case, $\\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{10^k}$, which has a non-zero hundredths digit if and only if $k \\geq 2$. There are $k-1$ positive integers $n$ of the form $10^k$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nIf $n$ is a product of powers of $2$ and $5$, then it has the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some non-negative integers $a$ and $b$. In this case, $\\frac{1}{n}$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2^a \\cdot 5^b}$, which has a non-zero hundredths digit if and only if $a \\geq 2$ or $b \\geq 2$. There are $(a+1)(b+1) - 1$ positive integers $n$ of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ that satisfy this condition.\n\nTherefore, the total number of positive integers $n$ that yield a terminating decimal with a non-zero hundredths digit is the sum of the number of positive integers of the form $10^k$ and the number of positive integers of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$. This sum is equal to $\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} (k-1) + \\sum_{a=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{b=2}^{\\infty} [(a+1)(b+1) - 1]$.\n\nEvaluating this sum is beyond the scope of this question, but it is clear that there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ that satisfy the given condition."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25?", "solution": "Let us investigate the first few powers of 19: \\begin{align*}\n19^1 &\\equiv 19 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^2 &\\equiv 11 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^3 &\\equiv 9 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^4 &\\equiv 21 \\pmod{25} \\\\\n19^5 &\\equiv 24 \\pmod{25}.\n\\end{align*} At this point, we see that $19^5 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ hence $19^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{25}.$ That means that $19^{1999} = 19^9 \\cdot (19^{10})^{199} \\equiv 19^9 \\pmod {25}.$\n\nSince $19^4 \\equiv 21 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{25}$ and $19^5 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{25},$ then $19^{1999} \\equiv 19^9 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{25},$ hence our desired remainder is $\\boxed{4}.$", "pred": "To find the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by 25, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic. \n\nStep 1: Find the remainder of $19$ divided by $25$. \nThe remainder of $19$ divided by $25$ is $19$.\n\nStep 2: Find the remainder of $19^2$ divided by $25$. \n$19^2 = 361$, and the remainder of $361$ divided by $25$ is $11$.\n\nStep 3: Find the remainder of $19^3$ divided by $25$. \n$19^3 = 6859$, and the remainder of $6859$ divided by $25$ is $9$.\n\nStep 4: Continue this process until we reach $19^{1999}$. \n\nSince the remainders of $19^2$ and $19^3$ are $11$ and $9$ respectively, we can observe a pattern. The remainders of $19^4$, $19^5$, $19^6$, and so on, will also be $11$ and $9$ alternately. \n\nSince $1999$ is an odd number, the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by $25$ will be the same as the remainder of $19^3$ divided by $25$, which is $9$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder of $19^{1999}$ divided by $25$ is $9$."}

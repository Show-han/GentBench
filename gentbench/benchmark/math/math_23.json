{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Compute the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome when written in both base 2 and 4.", "solution": "We start by testing palindromic sequences in base 4. Since the positive integer must be greater than 5, we start by analyzing $22_4$, which is $1010_2$. We then test $33_4$, which is $1111_2$. Converting to base 10, we have $33_4 = 3(4) + 3 = \\boxed{15}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the number 6, as it is the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5.\n2. Convert 6 to binary (base 2). In base 2, 6 is represented as 110.\n3. Check if the binary representation of 6 (110) is a palindrome. In this case, it is not a palindrome.\n4. Increment the number by 1 to get 7.\n5. Convert 7 to binary (base 2). In base 2, 7 is represented as 111.\n6. Check if the binary representation of 7 (111) is a palindrome. In this case, it is a palindrome.\n7. Convert 7 to base 4. In base 4, 7 is represented as 13.\n8. Check if the base 4 representation of 7 (13) is a palindrome. In this case, it is not a palindrome.\n9. Increment the number by 1 to get 8.\n10. Convert 8 to binary (base 2). In base 2, 8 is represented as 1000.\n11. Check if the binary representation of 8 (1000) is a palindrome. In this case, it is not a palindrome.\n12. Convert 8 to base 4. In base 4, 8 is represented as 20.\n13. Check if the base 4 representation of 8 (20) is a palindrome. In this case, it is not a palindrome.\n14. Increment the number by 1 to get 9.\n15. Convert 9 to binary (base 2). In base 2, 9 is represented as 1001.\n16. Check if the binary representation of 9 (1001) is a palindrome. In this case, it is a palindrome.\n17. Convert 9 to base 4. In base 4, 9 is represented as 21.\n18. Check if the base 4 representation of 9 (21) is a palindrome. In this case, it is a palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the smallest base-10 positive integer greater than 5 that is a palindrome in both base 2 and base 4 is 9."}

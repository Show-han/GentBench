{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $a_{10} = 10$, and for each positive integer $n >10$ let $a_n = 100a_{n - 1} + n$. Find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$.\n", "solution": "Writing out the recursive statement for $a_n, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_{10}$ and summing them gives\\[a_n+\\dots+a_{10}=100(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+n+\\dots+10\\]Which simplifies to\\[a_n=99(a_{n-1}+\\dots+a_{10})+\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)\\]Therefore, $a_n$ is divisible by 99 if and only if $\\frac{1}{2}(n+10)(n-9)$ is divisible by 99, so $(n+10)(n-9)$ needs to be divisible by 9 and 11. Assume that $n+10$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=12, 23, 34, 45$, we see that $n=45$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. Next, assume that $n-9$ is a multiple of 11. Writing out a few terms, $n=20, 31, 42, 53$, we see that $n=53$ is the smallest $n$ that works in this case. The smallest $n$ is $\\boxed{45}$.\nNote that we can also construct the solution using CRT by assuming either $11$ divides $n+10$ and $9$ divides $n-9$, or $9$ divides $n+10$ and $11$ divides $n-9$, and taking the smaller solution.", "pred": "We can start by finding the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$. We have $a_{11} = 100a_{10} + 11 = 100(10) + 11 = 1011$. Similarly, $a_{12} = 100(1011) + 12 = 101112$, $a_{13} = 100(101112) + 13 = 10111213$, and so on.\n\nWe notice that the first few terms of the sequence have a pattern: $10$, $1011$, $101112$, $10111213$, and so on. In general, the $n$th term of the sequence is formed by concatenating the numbers $10, 11, 12, \\ldots, n$.\n\nTo find the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that $a_n$ is divisible by $99$. In other words, we need to find the smallest $n$ such that $a_n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{99}$.\n\nWe can write $a_n$ as $10 \\cdot 10^0 + 11 \\cdot 10^2 + 12 \\cdot 10^4 + \\cdots + n \\cdot 10^{2(n-10)}$. Notice that $10^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{99}$, so $10^{2(n-10)} \\equiv 1^{n-10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{99}$.\n\nTherefore, we have $a_n \\equiv 10 \\cdot 1 + 11 \\cdot 1 + 12 \\cdot 1 + \\cdots + n \\cdot 1 \\equiv 10 + 11 + 12 + \\cdots + n \\pmod{99}$.\n\nThe sum $10 + 11 + 12 + \\cdots + n$ is an arithmetic series with first term $10$ and common difference $1$. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms, so we have $\\frac{10 + n}{2} \\cdot (n - 10 + 1) = \\frac{10 + n}{2} \\cdot (n - 9)$.\n\nWe want this sum to be divisible by $99$, so we have $\\frac{10 + n}{2} \\cdot (n - 9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{99}$. Since $99$ is divisible by $9$, we can divide both sides of the congruence by $9$ to get $\\frac{10 + n}{2} \\cdot (n - 9) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nSince $11$ is prime, we know that $\\frac{10 + n}{2} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$ or $n - 9 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. The first congruence gives us $n \\equiv -10 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$, and the second congruence gives us $n \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive $n > 10$ such that $a_n$ is a multiple of $99$ is $n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ and $n \\equiv 9 \\pmod{11}$. The smallest such $n$ is $n = \\boxed{10}$."}

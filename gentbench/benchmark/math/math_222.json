{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $n$ be a positive integer. If $a\\equiv (3^{2n}+4)^{-1}\\pmod{9}$, what is the remainder when $a$ is divided by $9$?", "solution": "We have that \\[a\\equiv (3^{2n}+4)^{-1}\\equiv (9^{n}+4)^{-1}\\equiv 4^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{7}\\pmod{9}.\\]", "pred": "We want to find the remainder when $(3^{2n}+4)^{-1}$ is divided by $9$. \n\nFirst, we note that $3^{2n}$ is always congruent to $1$ modulo $9$ because $3^2\\equiv 9\\equiv 0\\pmod{9}$ and $3^{2n}\\equiv (3^2)^n\\equiv 0^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$.\n\nTherefore, $(3^{2n}+4)^{-1}\\equiv (1+4)^{-1}\\equiv 5^{-1}\\pmod{9}$.\n\nTo find the inverse of $5$ modulo $9$, we can check each number from $1$ to $8$ and see which one, when multiplied by $5$, gives a remainder of $1$ when divided by $9$. We find that $5\\cdot 2\\equiv 10\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$, so the inverse of $5$ modulo $9$ is $2$.\n\nTherefore, $(3^{2n}+4)^{-1}\\equiv 5^{-1}\\equiv \\boxed{2}\\pmod{9}$."}

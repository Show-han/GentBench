{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $P$ be the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers. Find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k .$\n", "solution": "Note that the product of the first $100$ positive odd integers can be written as $1\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 7\\cdots 195\\cdot 197\\cdot 199=\\frac{1\\cdot 2\\cdots200}{2\\cdot4\\cdots200} = \\frac{200!}{2^{100}\\cdot 100!}$\nHence, we seek the number of threes in $200!$ decreased by the number of threes in $100!.$\nThere are\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{200}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{200}{81}\\right\\rfloor =66+22+7+2=97$\nthrees in $200!$ and\n$\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{3}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{9}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor \\frac{100}{27}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{100}{81}\\right\\rfloor=33+11+3+1=48$\nthrees in $100!$\nTherefore, we have a total of $97-48=\\boxed{49}$ threes.", "pred": "The first $100$ positive odd integers are $1, 3, 5, \\dots, 197, 199$. We want to find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$.\n\nStep 1: Count the number of odd integers in the list that are divisible by $3$. We can do this by dividing each odd integer by $3$ and checking if the remainder is $0$. We find that $3, 9, 15, \\dots, 195$ are divisible by $3$. There are $\\frac{195-3}{6} + 1 = 33$ odd integers divisible by $3$.\n\nStep 2: Count the number of odd integers in the list that are divisible by $3^2$. We can do this by dividing each odd integer by $3^2$ and checking if the remainder is $0$. We find that $9, 15, 21, \\dots, 195$ are divisible by $3^2$. There are $\\frac{195-9}{6} + 1 = 33$ odd integers divisible by $3^2$.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of odd integers in the list that are divisible by $3^3$. We can do this by dividing each odd integer by $3^3$ and checking if the remainder is $0$. We find that $27, 33, 39, \\dots, 195$ are divisible by $3^3$. There are $\\frac{195-27}{6} + 1 = 29$ odd integers divisible by $3^3$.\n\nStep 4: Continue this process until we reach $3^k$ for some $k$. We find that there are $33$ odd integers divisible by $3^4$, $33$ odd integers divisible by $3^5$, and so on.\n\nStep 5: Since we want to find the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$, we stop when the number of odd integers divisible by $3^k$ is $0$. In this case, we stop at $k=4$ because there are no odd integers divisible by $3^5$.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, the largest integer $k$ such that $P$ is divisible by $3^k$ is $\\boxed{4}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For some positive integer $n$, the number $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors, including $1$ and the number $110n^3$. How many positive integer divisors does the number $81n^4$ have?\n$\\textbf{(A) }110\\qquad\\textbf{(B) }191\\qquad\\textbf{(C) }261\\qquad\\textbf{(D) }325\\qquad\\textbf{(E) }425$\n", "solution": "Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$. This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$. This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$, so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors. To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$, so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$, so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors. Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$. In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$, we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$, and find the factors of that number. We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$, and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{325}$ factors.", "pred": "We know that $110n^3$ has $110$ positive integer divisors. Since $110 = 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, we know that $110n^3$ must be in the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot 11^c$ where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Therefore, the number of divisors of $110n^3$ is $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)$. We are given that this is equal to $110$. \nNow, we want to find the number of divisors of $81n^4$. Since $81 = 3^4$, we can write $81n^4$ as $3^{4+d} \\cdot 2^a \\cdot 5^b \\cdot 11^c$ where $d$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers. Therefore, the number of divisors of $81n^4$ is $(4+d+1)(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)$. We want to find the value of $(4+d+1)(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)$.\nSince $(a+1)(b+1)(c+1) = 110$, we can substitute this into the equation to get $(4+d+1)(110)$. We know that $(4+d+1)(110) = 110(4+d+1) = 110(5+d)$. Since $d$ is a positive integer, the smallest possible value of $d$ is $1$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $(4+d+1)(110)$ is $110(5+1) = 660$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $(4+d+1)(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }425}$."}

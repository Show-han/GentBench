{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many positive integers $n\\geq 2$ is $1001_n$ a prime number?", "solution": "We see that the given number is equal to $1 \\cdot n^3 + 1 = n^3 + 1$. Using the sum of cubes factorization, it follows that $n^3 + 1 = (n+1)(n^2 - n + 1)$. Since $1$ is a digit in the base, then $n > 1$, and $n+1 > 1$ and $n^2 - n + 1 > n - n + 1 = 1$, so $n^3 + 1$ is the product of two integers greater than $1$. Thus, $1001_n$ is prime for $\\boxed{0}$ values of $n$.", "pred": "To determine if $1001_n$ is a prime number, we need to consider the possible values of $n$.\n\nStep 1: The number $1001_n$ can be written as $n^3 + 1$ in base $10$.\n\nStep 2: We want to find values of $n$ such that $n^3 + 1$ is a prime number.\n\nStep 3: We can use the fact that $a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)$ to factorize $n^3 + 1$.\n\nStep 4: Applying the factorization, we have $n^3 + 1 = (n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)$.\n\nStep 5: For $n^3 + 1$ to be prime, either $n + 1 = 1$ or $n^2 - n + 1 = 1$.\n\nStep 6: If $n + 1 = 1$, then $n = 0$, which is not a positive integer.\n\nStep 7: If $n^2 - n + 1 = 1$, then $n^2 - n = 0$, which implies $n(n - 1) = 0$.\n\nStep 8: The solutions to $n(n - 1) = 0$ are $n = 0$ and $n = 1$.\n\nStep 9: However, $n = 0$ is not a positive integer, so the only valid solution is $n = 1$.\n\nStep 10: Therefore, there is only $1$ positive integer $n \\geq 2$ for which $1001_n$ is a prime number."}

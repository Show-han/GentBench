{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many of the integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers?\n", "solution": "Notice that all odd numbers can be obtained by using $(a+1)^2-a^2=2a+1,$ where $a$ is a nonnegative integer. All multiples of $4$ can be obtained by using $(b+1)^2-(b-1)^2 = 4b$, where $b$ is a positive integer. Numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 4$ cannot be obtained because squares are $0, 1 \\pmod 4.$ Thus, the answer is $500+250 = \\boxed{750}.$", "pred": "To find the integers between 1 and 1000 that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the smallest nonnegative integer, 0.\n2. Square 0 to get 0.\n3. Subtract 0 from 0 to get 0.\n4. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 1.\n5. Square 1 to get 1.\n6. Subtract 0 from 1 to get 1.\n7. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 2.\n8. Square 2 to get 4.\n9. Subtract 0 from 4 to get 4.\n10. Subtract 1 from 4 to get 3.\n11. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 3.\n12. Square 3 to get 9.\n13. Subtract 0 from 9 to get 9.\n14. Subtract 1 from 9 to get 8.\n15. Subtract 4 from 9 to get 5.\n16. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 4.\n17. Square 4 to get 16.\n18. Subtract 0 from 16 to get 16.\n19. Subtract 1 from 16 to get 15.\n20. Subtract 4 from 16 to get 12.\n21. Subtract 9 from 16 to get 7.\n22. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 5.\n23. Square 5 to get 25.\n24. Subtract 0 from 25 to get 25.\n25. Subtract 1 from 25 to get 24.\n26. Subtract 4 from 25 to get 21.\n27. Subtract 9 from 25 to get 16.\n28. Subtract 16 from 25 to get 9.\n29. Move to the next nonnegative integer, 6.\n30. Continue this process until reaching the largest nonnegative integer, 31.\n\nBy following these steps, we can find that there are 31 integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, that can be expressed as the difference of the squares of two nonnegative integers."}

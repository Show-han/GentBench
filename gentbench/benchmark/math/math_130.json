{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $[r,s]$ denote the least common multiple of positive integers $r$ and $s$. Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$.\n", "solution": "It's clear that we must have $a = 2^j5^k$, $b = 2^m 5^n$ and $c = 2^p5^q$ for some nonnegative integers $j, k, m, n, p, q$. Dealing first with the powers of 2: from the given conditions, $\\max(j, m) = 3$, $\\max(m, p) = \\max(p, j) = 4$. Thus we must have $p = 4$ and at least one of $m, j$ equal to 3. This gives 7 possible triples $(j, m, p)$: $(0, 3, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), (3, 3, 4), (3, 2, 4), (3, 1, 4)$ and $(3, 0, 4)$.\nNow, for the powers of 5: we have $\\max(k, n) = \\max(n, q) = \\max(q, k) = 3$. Thus, at least two of $k, n, q$ must be equal to 3, and the other can take any value between 0 and 3. This gives us a total of 10 possible triples: $(3, 3, 3)$ and three possibilities of each of the forms $(3, 3, n)$, $(3, n, 3)$ and $(n, 3, 3)$.\nSince the exponents of 2 and 5 must satisfy these conditions independently, we have a total of $7 \\cdot 10 = \\boxed{70}$ possible valid triples.", "pred": "We know that $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$. Since $[a,b] = 1000$, we know that $a$ and $b$ must have a common factor of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3$. Similarly, since $[b,c] = 2000$, we know that $b$ and $c$ must have a common factor of $2^4 \\cdot 5^3$. Finally, since $[c,a] = 2000$, we know that $c$ and $a$ must have a common factor of $2^4 \\cdot 5^3$. \n\nLet $a = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot x$, $b = 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot y$, and $c = 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot z$, where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers. Substituting these values into the equations, we get $[2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot x, 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot y] = 1000$, $[2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot y, 2^4 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot z] = 2000$, and $[2^4 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot z, 2^3 \\cdot 5^3 \\cdot x] = 2000$. \n\nSimplifying these equations, we get $[x, y] = 1$, $[y, z] = 2$, and $[z, x] = 2$. Since $[x, y] = 1$, we know that $x$ and $y$ must be relatively prime. Similarly, since $[y, z] = 2$, we know that $y$ and $z$ must have a common factor of $2$. Finally, since $[z, x] = 2$, we know that $z$ and $x$ must have a common factor of $2$. \n\nLet $x = 2 \\cdot m$, $y = n$, and $z = 2 \\cdot p$, where $m$, $n$, and $p$ are positive integers. Substituting these values into the equations, we get $[2 \\cdot m, n] = 1$, $[n, 2 \\cdot p] = 2$, and $[2 \\cdot p, 2 \\cdot m] = 2$. \n\nSimplifying these equations, we get $[m, n] = 1$, $[n, p] = 1$, and $[p, m] = 1$. Since $[m, n] = 1$, we know that $m$ and $n$ must be relatively prime. Similarly, since $[n, p] = 1$, we know that $n$ and $p$ must be relatively prime. Finally, since $[p, m] = 1$, we know that $p$ and $m$ must be relatively prime. \n\nTherefore, the number of ordered triples $(a, b, c)$ is equal to the number of ordered triples $(x, y, z)$, which is equal to the number of ordered triples $(2 \\cdot m, n, 2 \\cdot p)$, which is equal to the number of ordered triples $(m, n, p)$. \n\nSince $m$, $n$, and $p$ must be relatively prime, there are $\\boxed{1}$ possible value for each of them."}

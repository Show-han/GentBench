{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $f(n)$ return the number of distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ such that for each ordered pair, $a^2 + b^2 = n$. Note that when $a \\neq b$, $(a, b)$ and $(b, a)$ are distinct. What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$?", "solution": "If $f(n) = 3$, this implies that $n = 2m^2$ for some positive integer $m$ since the only time $f(n)$ can be odd is when there is an ordered pair $(m, m)$ that cannot be reversed. We start testing values of $m$. The values $m = 1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, and $m=4$ do not give $f(n)=3$. However, when $m=5$, we get $50 = 5^2 + 5^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 7^2 + 1^2$. Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which $f(n)=3$ is $\\boxed{50}$.", "pred": "We start by listing out the possible values of $f(n)$ for small values of $n$. For $n = 1$, we have $f(1) = 1$ since the only ordered pair that satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ is $(1, 0)$. For $n = 2$, we have $f(2) = 2$ since the ordered pairs $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 0)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 2$. For $n = 3$, we have $f(3) = 1$ since the only ordered pair that satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = 3$ is $(2, 1)$. For $n = 4$, we have $f(4) = 2$ since the ordered pairs $(2, 2)$ and $(4, 0)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 4$. For $n = 5$, we have $f(5) = 2$ since the ordered pairs $(2, 1)$ and $(4, 3)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 5$. For $n = 6$, we have $f(6) = 4$ since the ordered pairs $(1, 5)$, $(2, 4)$, $(4, 2)$, and $(5, 1)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 6$. For $n = 7$, we have $f(7) = 0$ since there are no ordered pairs that satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 7$. For $n = 8$, we have $f(8) = 2$ since the ordered pairs $(2, 2)$ and $(4, 4)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 8$. For $n = 9$, we have $f(9) = 1$ since the only ordered pair that satisfies $a^2 + b^2 = 9$ is $(3, 0)$. For $n = 10$, we have $f(10) = 4$ since the ordered pairs $(1, 3)$, $(3, 1)$, $(4, 2)$, and $(5, 5)$ satisfy $a^2 + b^2 = 10$. We can continue listing out the values of $f(n)$ for larger values of $n$, but we notice that $f(n)$ is always even for $n \\geq 2$. Therefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $f(n) = 3$ is $\\boxed{11}$."}

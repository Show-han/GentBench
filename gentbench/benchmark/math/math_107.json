{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 120 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminate?", "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $120$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $3$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{120-1}{3} \\right\\rfloor+1=40$ multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $120$, so there are $\\boxed{40}$ integers values for $n$.", "pred": "To determine if the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{120}$ terminates, we need to determine if the denominator, 120, can be factored into the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe prime factorization of 120 is $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^1$. \n\nFor the decimal representation to terminate, we need to have $a \\geq 3$ and $b \\geq 1$. \n\nSince $a$ can be 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (6 possibilities) and $b$ can be 1 (1 possibility), there are $6 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{6}$ possible values of $n$."}

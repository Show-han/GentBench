{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ are multiples of 24?", "solution": "Because $24 = 3\\cdot 2^3$, a square is divisible by 24 if and only if it is divisible by $3^2\\cdot 2^4 = 144$. Furthermore, a perfect square $N^2$ less than $10^6$ is a multiple of 144 if and only if $N$ is a multiple of 12 less than $10^3$. Because 996 is the largest multiple of 12 less than $10^3$, there are $\\frac{996}{12}= 83$ such positive integers less than $10^3$ and $\\boxed{83}$ positive perfect squares which are multiples of 24.", "pred": "To find the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24, we can break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the perfect squares less than $10^6$. The largest perfect square less than $10^6$ is $31^2 = 961$. So, we need to consider perfect squares from 1 to 961.\n\nStep 2: Determine which of these perfect squares are multiples of 24. To be a multiple of 24, a perfect square must have at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 3. We can check this by looking at the prime factorization of each perfect square.\n\nStep 3: Count the number of perfect squares that meet the criteria. By checking the prime factorization of each perfect square, we can count the number of squares that have at least two factors of 2 and one factor of 3.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of positive perfect squares less than $10^6$ that are multiples of 24."}

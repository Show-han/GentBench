{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For each positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-four representation of $n$ and let $g(n)$ be the sum of the digits in the base-eight representation of $f(n)$. For example, $f(2020) = f(133210_{\\text{4}}) = 10 = 12_{\\text{8}}$, and $g(2020) = \\text{the digit sum of }12_{\\text{8}} = 3$. Let $N$ be the least value of $n$ such that the base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n", "solution": "Let's work backwards. The minimum base-sixteen representation of $g(n)$ that cannot be expressed using only the digits $0$ through $9$ is $A_{16}$, which is equal to $10$ in base 10. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-eight representation of the sum of the digits of $f(n)$ is $10$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $37_8$. We have that $37_8 = 31$. Thus, the sum of the digits of the base-four representation of $n$ is $31$. The minimum value for which this is achieved is $13,333,333,333_4$. We just need this value in base 10 modulo 1000. We get $13,333,333,333_4 = 3(1 + 4 + 4^2 + \\dots + 4^8 + 4^9) + 4^{10} = 3\\left(\\dfrac{4^{10} - 1}{3}\\right) + 4^{10} = 2*4^{10} - 1$. Taking this value modulo $1000$, we get the final answer of $\\boxed{151}$.", "pred": "We start by finding the values of $g(n)$ for small values of $n$:\n\\begin{align*} g(1) &= g(1_{10}) = 1 \\\\ g(2) &= g(2_{10}) = 2 \\\\ g(3) &= g(3_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(4) &= g(4_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(5) &= g(5_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(6) &= g(6_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(7) &= g(7_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(8) &= g(10_{10}) = 1 \\\\ g(9) &= g(11_{10}) = 2 \\\\ g(10) &= g(12_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(11) &= g(13_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(12) &= g(14_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(13) &= g(15_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(14) &= g(20_{10}) = 2 \\\\ g(15) &= g(21_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(16) &= g(22_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(17) &= g(23_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(18) &= g(24_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(19) &= g(25_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(20) &= g(30_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(21) &= g(31_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(22) &= g(32_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(23) &= g(33_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(24) &= g(34_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(25) &= g(35_{10}) = 8 \\\\ g(26) &= g(40_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(27) &= g(41_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(28) &= g(42_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(29) &= g(43_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(30) &= g(44_{10}) = 8 \\\\ g(31) &= g(45_{10}) = 9 \\\\ g(32) &= g(50_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(33) &= g(51_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(34) &= g(52_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(35) &= g(53_{10}) = 8 \\\\ g(36) &= g(54_{10}) = 9 \\\\ g(37) &= g(55_{10}) = 10 \\\\ g(38) &= g(100_{10}) = 1 \\\\ g(39) &= g(101_{10}) = 2 \\\\ g(40) &= g(102_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(41) &= g(103_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(42) &= g(104_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(43) &= g(105_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(44) &= g(110_{10}) = 2 \\\\ g(45) &= g(111_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(46) &= g(112_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(47) &= g(113_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(48) &= g(114_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(49) &= g(115_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(50) &= g(120_{10}) = 3 \\\\ g(51) &= g(121_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(52) &= g(122_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(53) &= g(123_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(54) &= g(124_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(55) &= g(125_{10}) = 8 \\\\ g(56) &= g(130_{10}) = 4 \\\\ g(57) &= g(131_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(58) &= g(132_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(59) &= g(133_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(60) &= g(134_{10}) = 8 \\\\ g(61) &= g(135_{10}) = 9 \\\\ g(62) &= g(140_{10}) = 5 \\\\ g(63) &= g(141_{10}) = 6 \\\\ g(64) &= g(142_{10}) = 7 \\\\ g(65) &= g(143_{10}) = 8 \\\\"}

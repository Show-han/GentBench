{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For $1 \\le n \\le 100$, how many integers are there such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal?", "solution": "Note that $n+1$ and $n$ will never share any common factors except for $1$, because they are consecutive integers. Therefore, $n/(n+1)$ is already simplified, for all positive integers $n$.\n\nSince $1 \\le n \\le 100$, it follows that $2 \\le n+1 \\le 101$. Recall that a simplified fraction has a repeating decimal representation if and only if its denominator is divisible by a prime other than 2 and 5. The numbers between 2 and 101 which are divisible only by 2 and 5 comprise the set $\\{2, 4, 5, 8, \\allowbreak 10, 16, 20, 25, \\allowbreak 32, 40, 50, 64, \\allowbreak 80, 100\\}$. Therefore, there are $14$ terminating decimals and $100 - 14 = \\boxed{86}$ repeating decimals.", "pred": "To determine how many integers satisfy the given condition, we need to find the number of integers $n$ such that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal.\n\nStep 1: Consider the fraction $\\frac{n}{n+1}$. We want to express it as a repeating decimal.\n\nStep 2: To do this, we divide $n$ by $n+1$ using long division. The quotient will be the whole number part of the decimal representation, and the remainder will be the repeating part.\n\nStep 3: Since $1 \\le n \\le 100$, the possible values of $n$ are $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100$. We can go through each value of $n$ and perform the long division to determine if $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal.\n\nStep 4: If the remainder is zero, then $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is not a repeating decimal. If the remainder is nonzero, then $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal.\n\nStep 5: Count the number of values of $n$ for which the remainder is nonzero. This will give us the number of integers that satisfy the given condition.\n\nNote: We can also observe that $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ is a repeating decimal if and only if $n+1$ is not a power of $2$ or $5$. This is because the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{n+1}$ repeats if and only if the denominator $n+1$ has a prime factor other than $2$ or $5$."}

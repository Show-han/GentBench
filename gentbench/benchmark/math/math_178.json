{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the sum of all positive integers $n$ such that, given an unlimited supply of stamps of denominations $5,n,$ and $n+1$ cents, $91$ cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed.\n", "solution": "By the Chicken McNugget theorem, the least possible value of $n$ such that $91$ cents cannot be formed satisfies $5n - (5 + n) = 91 \\implies n = 24$, so $n$ must be at least $24$.\nFor a value of $n$ to work, we must not only be unable to form the value $91$, but we must also be able to form the values $92$ through $96$, as with these five values, we can form any value greater than $96$ by using additional $5$ cent stamps.\nNotice that we must form the value $96$ without forming the value $91$. If we use any $5$ cent stamps when forming $96$, we could simply remove one to get $91$. This means that we must obtain the value $96$ using only stamps of denominations $n$ and $n+1$.\nRecalling that $n \\geq 24$, we can easily figure out the working $(n,n+1)$ pairs that can used to obtain $96$, as we can use at most $\\frac{96}{24}=4$ stamps without going over. The potential sets are $(24, 25), (31, 32), (32, 33), (47, 48), (48, 49), (95, 96)$, and $(96, 97)$.\nThe last two obviously do not work, since they are too large to form the values $92$ through $94$, and by a little testing, only $(24, 25)$ and $(47, 48)$ can form the necessary values, so $n \\in \\{24, 47\\}$. $24 + 47 = \\boxed{71}$.", "pred": "First, we note that we can form any amount of postage greater than $91$ cents by using a combination of $5$ cent stamps, $n$ cent stamps, and $n+1$ cent stamps. \n\nNext, we consider the case where we use only $5$ cent stamps. The largest amount of postage we can form using only $5$ cent stamps is $5 \\cdot 18 = 90$ cents. Therefore, $91$ cents cannot be formed using only $5$ cent stamps.\n\nNow, we consider the case where we use $5$ cent stamps and $n$ cent stamps. The largest amount of postage we can form using only $5$ cent stamps and $n$ cent stamps is $5 \\cdot 18 + n \\cdot 1 = 90 + n$ cents. Therefore, $91$ cents cannot be formed using only $5$ cent stamps and $n$ cent stamps if $n \\geq 1$.\n\nFinally, we consider the case where we use $5$ cent stamps, $n$ cent stamps, and $n+1$ cent stamps. The largest amount of postage we can form using these stamps is $5 \\cdot 18 + n \\cdot 1 + (n+1) \\cdot 1 = 91 + 2n$ cents. Therefore, $91$ cents cannot be formed using $5$ cent stamps, $n$ cent stamps, and $n+1$ cent stamps if $n \\geq 1$.\n\nCombining all the cases, we conclude that $91$ cents is the greatest postage that cannot be formed using $5$ cent stamps, $n$ cent stamps, and $n+1$ cent stamps if $n \\geq 1$. \n\nTherefore, the sum of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy this condition is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 90 = \\frac{90 \\cdot 91}{2} = \\boxed{4095}$."}

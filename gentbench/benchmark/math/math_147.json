{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many distinct four-digit numbers are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits?", "solution": "A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So a  four-digit number $ab23$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if the two-digit number $ab$ leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. There are 90 two-digit numbers, of which $90/3 = \\boxed{30}$ leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.", "pred": "To find the number of distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits, we need to consider the possible values for the first two digits.\n\nStep 1: Determine the possible values for the first digit.\nSince the number needs to be divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. The possible values for the first digit are 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8.\n\nStep 2: Determine the possible values for the second digit.\nThe second digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, as there are no restrictions on it.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the number of possibilities for the first and second digits.\nSince the first and second digits can be chosen independently, we multiply the number of possibilities for each digit. In this case, there are 6 possibilities for the first digit and 10 possibilities for the second digit.\n\nStep 4: Multiply the result by the number of possibilities for the last two digits.\nSince the last two digits are fixed at 23, there is only one possibility for them.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the final result.\nMultiply the number of possibilities for the first and second digits by the number of possibilities for the last two digits. In this case, the final result is 6 * 10 * 1 = 60.\n\nTherefore, there are 60 distinct four-digit numbers that are divisible by 3 and have 23 as their last two digits."}

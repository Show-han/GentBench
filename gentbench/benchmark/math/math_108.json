{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer?", "solution": "The expression $2n-1$ is odd for every integer $n$, and conversely every odd integer takes the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$.  Therefore, there is one solution $n$ for each (not necessarily positive) odd divisor of 20.  The positive odd divisors of 20 are 1 and 5, so we solve $2n-1=-5$, $2n-1=-1$, $2n-1=1$, and $2n-1=5$ to find the solutions $n=-2$, $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=3$.  These values for $n$ sum to $\\boxed{2}$.", "pred": "To find the sum of all integer values of $n$ such that $\\frac{20}{2n - 1}$ is an integer, we can set up the equation $\\frac{20}{2n - 1} = k$, where $k$ is an integer. \n\nFirst, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $2n - 1$ to get rid of the denominator: $20 = k(2n - 1)$. \n\nNext, we can distribute $k$ to get $20 = 2kn - k$. \n\nRearranging the equation, we have $2kn - k = 20$. \n\nFactoring out $k$, we get $k(2n - 1) = 20$. \n\nNow, we can list all the possible values of $k$ and $2n - 1$ that multiply to give $20$. \n\nThe possible values of $k$ are $1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20$. \n\nThe corresponding values of $2n - 1$ are $20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1$. \n\nSolving for $n$ in each case, we find that the possible values of $n$ are $11, 6, 3, 2, 1, 0$. \n\nThe sum of all these integer values of $n$ is $11 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 = \\boxed{23}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Every 5 months, Hal has to replace the batteries in his calculator. He changed them the first time in May. In what month will they be changed the 25th time?", "solution": "If the first time was in May, the second time will be 5 months after May, the third time will be $5\\cdot2$ months after May, etc. That means the 25th time will be $5\\cdot24$ months away. Since the months repeat every 12 months, we look for the remainder when $5\\cdot24$ is divided by 12 and add that many months to May. We notice that $\\frac{5\\cdot24}{12}=5\\cdot2$, so it turns out that $5\\cdot24$ is a multiple of 12 and leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 12. So the 25th time will be a certain number of years afterward but still in the same month, $\\boxed{\\text{May}}$.", "pred": "Hal changes the batteries every 5 months, so to find out in what month the 25th replacement will occur, we need to multiply 5 by 25. \n\n5 x 25 = 125\n\nSince Hal changed the batteries for the first time in May, we need to count 125 months from May to find the month of the 25th replacement. \n\n125 months after May is September. \n\nTherefore, the batteries will be changed for the 25th time in September."}

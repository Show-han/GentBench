{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: An integer $n$ is said to be square-free if the only perfect square that divides $n$ is $1^2$. How many positive odd integers greater than 1 and less than $100$ are square-free?", "solution": "If an integer $n$ is not square-free, then there is a square greater than $1$ that does divide $n$. The odd squares less than $100$ are $3^2 = 9$, $5^2 = 25$, $7^2 = 49$, and $9^2 = 81$. If an integer is divisible by $81$, then it is divisible by $9$, so we will only consider $3^2$, $5^2$, and $7^2$. There are $11$ multiples of $9$ that are less than $100$. Six of them are odd and five are even. There are $3$ multiples of $25$ that are less than $100$. Two of them are odd and one is even. There are $2$ multiples of $49$ that are less than $100$. One of them is odd and one is even. Therefore, there are $9$ odd integers that are not square-free. The least integer which is divisible by at least two of the integers 9, 25, and 49 is $9\\cdot 25 = 225$, which is greater than 100. Therefore, there are 9 odd integers less than 100 which are divisible by a perfect square greater than 1. There are $49$ odd integers less than $100$ and greater than 1, so there are $49-9=\\boxed{40}$ odd square-free integers less than $100$.", "pred": "To find the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are square-free, we can count the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are not square-free and subtract that from the total number of positive odd integers less than $100$.\n\nFirst, we find the total number of positive odd integers less than $100$. There are $50$ positive odd integers less than $100$ because $99-1=98$ and $98/2=49$.\n\nNext, we find the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are not square-free. A positive odd integer is not square-free if it is divisible by a perfect square greater than $1^2=1$. The perfect squares less than $100$ are $4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81$. We can count the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by each of these perfect squares and subtract that from the total number of positive odd integers less than $100$.\n\nThere are $24$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $4$ because $99-1=98$, $98/2=49$, and $49/2=24$.\n\nThere are $11$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $9$ because $99-1=98$, $98/9=10$ with a remainder of $8$, and $8/2=4$.\n\nThere are $6$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $16$ because $99-1=98$, $98/16=6$ with a remainder of $2$, and $2/2=1$.\n\nThere are $3$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $25$ because $99-1=98$, $98/25=3$ with a remainder of $23$, and $23/2=11$.\n\nThere are $2$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are divisible by $36$ because $99-1=98$, $98/36=2$ with a remainder of $26$, and $26/2=13$.\n\nThere is $1$ positive odd integer less than $100$ that is divisible by $49$ because $99-1=98$, $98/49=2$ with no remainder, and $0/2=0$.\n\nThere is $1$ positive odd integer less than $100$ that is divisible by $64$ because $99-1=98$, $98/64=1$ with a remainder of $34$, and $34/2=17$.\n\nThere is $1$ positive odd integer less than $100$ that is divisible by $81$ because $99-1=98$, $98/81=1$ with a remainder of $17$, and $17/2=8$.\n\nAdding up all of these numbers, we find that there are $24+11+6+3+2+1+1+1=49$ positive odd integers less than $100$ that are not square-free.\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are not square-free from the total number of positive odd integers less than $100$ to find the number of positive odd integers less than $100$ that are square-free. $50-49=\\boxed{1}$."}

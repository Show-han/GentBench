{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: When the least common multiple of two positive integers is divided by their greatest common divisor, the result is 33. If one integer is 45, what is the smallest possible value of the other integer?", "solution": "Let $n$ be the other integer, so \\[\\frac{\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n]}{\\gcd(45,n)} = 33.\\]We know that $\\gcd(m,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[m,n] = mn$ for all positive integers $m$ and $n$, so \\[\\gcd(45,n) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,n] = 45n.\\]Dividing this equation by the previous equation, we get \\[[\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = \\frac{45n}{33} = \\frac{15n}{11},\\]so $11 [\\gcd(45,n)]^2 = 15n$.\n\nSince 11 divides the left-hand side, 11 also divides the right-hand side, which means $n$ is divisible by 11.  Also, 15 divides the right-hand side, so 15 divides the left-hand side, which means $\\gcd(45,n)$ is divisible by 15.  Since $45 = 3 \\cdot 15$, $n$ is divisible by 15.  Hence, $n$ must be divisible by $11 \\cdot 15 = 165$.\n\nNote that $\\gcd(45,165) = 15$ and $\\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[45,165] = 495$, and $495/15 = 33$, so $n=165$ is achievable and the smallest possible value of $n$ is $\\boxed{165}$.", "pred": "Let's denote the two positive integers as a and b. We are given that the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 33. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nLCM(a, b) / GCD(a, b) = 33\n\nWe are also given that one of the integers is 45, so let's assume a = 45. Now we can rewrite the equation as:\n\nLCM(45, b) / GCD(45, b) = 33\n\nTo find the smallest possible value of b, we need to find the GCD of 45 and b that satisfies the equation. Since 33 is a prime number, the GCD of 45 and b must be a factor of 33. The factors of 33 are 1 and 33.\n\nIf the GCD is 1, then the LCM(45, b) must be 33. However, this is not possible since 33 is not a multiple of 45.\n\nIf the GCD is 33, then the LCM(45, b) must be 33 * 33 = 1089. To find the smallest possible value of b, we need to find the smallest multiple of 45 that is greater than or equal to 1089. The smallest multiple of 45 greater than 1089 is 1125.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of the other integer (b) is 1125."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A rectangular array of chairs is an arrangement of the chairs in rows and columns such that each row contains the same number of chairs as every other row and each column contains the same number of chairs as every other column.  If there must be at least two chairs in every row and column and all of the chairs in the room must be included, how many arrays are possible in a classroom containing $36$ chairs? Note that $12$ rows of $3$ chairs is different from $3$ rows of $12$ chairs.", "solution": "We are counting the number of ways 36 can be expressed as the product of two positive integers such that one of the numbers is not 1. Factoring 36, we find that $36=2^2\\cdot3^2$. The possible values for the number of rows is 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 (notice that we cannot have 1 row). Each value corresponds to a unique arrangement of the chairs. Thus, there are $\\boxed{7}$ possible arrays.", "pred": "Since there must be at least two chairs in every row and column, the possible numbers of chairs in each row and column are $2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18,$ and $36$. We can now consider each case separately:\n\nCase 1: $2$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/2 = 18$ rows and $36/2 = 18$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 2: $3$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/3 = 12$ rows and $36/3 = 12$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 3: $4$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/4 = 9$ rows and $36/4 = 9$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 4: $6$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/6 = 6$ rows and $36/6 = 6$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 5: $9$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/9 = 4$ rows and $36/9 = 4$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 6: $12$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/12 = 3$ rows and $36/12 = 3$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 7: $18$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there are $36/18 = 2$ rows and $36/18 = 2$ columns. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nCase 8: $36$ chairs in each row and column.\nIn this case, there is $1$ row and $1$ column. The number of arrays is $1$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of arrays is $1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = \\boxed{8}$."}

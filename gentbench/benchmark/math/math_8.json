{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are digits in base $d > 6$ such that $\\overline{AB}_d + \\overline{AA}_d = 162_d$. Find $A_d - B_d$ in base $d$.", "solution": "Looking at the $d$'s place, we see that $A_d + A_d = 16_d = d + 6$ or $A_d + A_d + 1 = 16_d = d + 6$ (if there is carry-over). Re-arranging and solving for $A_d$, we find that $A_d = \\frac{d + 6}2$ or $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. In either case, since $d > 6$, it follows that $A_d > 2$. Thus, when we add the units digits $B_d + A_d$, there must be carry-over, so $A_d = \\frac{d + 5}2$. It follows that $$B_d + A_d = d + 2 \\Longrightarrow B_d = d+2 - \\frac{d + 5}2 = \\frac d2 - \\frac 12.$$Thus, $A_d - B_d = \\frac{d + 5}2 - \\frac{d-1}{2} = \\boxed{3}_d$.", "pred": "First, we can write the given equation as $dA + B + dA + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$. Simplifying, we have $2dA + B + A = d^2 + 6d + 2$. Since $d > 6$, we know that $d^2 + 6d + 2 > 2dA + B + A$. Therefore, $A = 1$. Substituting this back into the equation, we have $2d + B + 1 = d^2 + 6d + 2$. Rearranging, we have $d^2 + 4d - 2 = B - 2d - 1$. Since $d > 6$, we know that $d^2 + 4d - 2 > B - 2d - 1$. Therefore, $B = d^2 + 4d - 2 + 2d + 1 = d^2 + 6d - 1$. Finally, we have $A_d - B_d = 1_d - (d^2 + 6d - 1)_d = 1 - d^2 - 6d + 1 = \\boxed{-d^2 - 6d + 2}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many integer values of $n$ between 1 and 1000 inclusive does the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminate?", "solution": "The decimal representation of a simplified fraction terminates if and only if the denominator is divisible by no primes other than 2 and 5. The prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. For the fraction to simplify to having only the primes $2$ and $5$ in the denominator, there must be a factor of $7$ in the numerator. There are $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1000}{7}\\right\\rfloor=142$ multiples of $7$ between $1$ and $1000$, so there are $\\boxed{142}$ integers values for $n$.", "pred": "To determine if the decimal representation of $\\frac{n}{1400}$ terminates, we need to determine if the denominator $1400$ can be factored into the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$ for some nonnegative integers $a$ and $b$. \n\nThe prime factorization of $1400$ is $2^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7$. \n\nFor the decimal representation to terminate, we need to have $a \\geq 3$ and $b \\geq 2$. \n\nSince $a$ can be $3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, and $b$ can be $2, 3$, there are $6 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{12}$ possible values of $n$."}

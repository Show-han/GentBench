{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list?", "solution": "A perfect square that is a multiple of $20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5^1$ must be a multiple of $2^2 \\cdot 5^2 = 100$.  A perfect cube that is a multiple of 20 must be a multiple of $2^3 \\cdot 5^3 = 1000$.  Our goal is thus to count the multiples of 20 from 100 to 1000 inclusive: $$ 100 \\le 20n \\le 1000. $$Dividing this entire inequality by 20 we get $5 \\le n \\le 50$, so there are $50 - 5 + 1 = \\boxed{46}$ integers in Cameron's list.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, we need to find the smallest square number that is divisible by 20. The smallest square number divisible by 20 is 400 (20 * 20).\n\nTo find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, we need to find the smallest cube number that is divisible by 20. The smallest cube number divisible by 20 is 8000 (20 * 20 * 20).\n\nThe multiples of 20 between 400 and 8000 are 420, 440, 460, ..., 7960. To find the number of integers in this list, we can subtract the starting number (400) from the ending number (8000) and divide by the common difference (20). \n\n(8000 - 400) / 20 = 7600 / 20 = 380\n\nTherefore, there are 380 integers in Cameron's list."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many positive perfect square integers are factors of the product $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$?", "solution": "There are six possible square powers of two that can divide the given number: $2^0$, $2^2$, $2^4$, $2^6$, $2^8$, and $2^{10}$. Similarly, there are seven possible square powers of three that can divide the given number, and eight possible square powers of five that can divide the given number. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 7 \\times 8 = \\boxed{336}$ positive perfect square integers that can divide $\\left(2^{10}\\right)\\left(3^{12}\\right)\\left(5^{15}\\right)$.", "pred": "To find the number of positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product, we need to determine the exponents of the prime factors that are multiples of 2. \n\nThe exponent of 2 in the product is $10$, which means that the exponents of 2 in the factors can be any even number from $0$ to $10$. There are $6$ even numbers in this range: $0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10$.\n\nTherefore, there are $\\boxed{6}$ positive perfect square integers that are factors of the given product."}

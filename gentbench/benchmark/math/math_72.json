{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: When $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004}$ is divided by $1000$, a remainder of $N$ is obtained. Determine the value of $N$.\n", "solution": "By the geometric series formula, $1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} = \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$. Since $\\varphi(1000) = 400$, by Fermat-Euler's Theorem, this is equivalent to finding $\\frac{7^{400 \\cdot 5 + 5} - 1}{6} \\equiv \\frac{7^5 - 1}{6} \\equiv \\boxed{801} \\pmod{1000}$.", "pred": "We can rewrite the given expression as a geometric series: \\begin{align*}\n1 + 7 + 7^2 + \\cdots + 7^{2004} &= \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{7-1} \\\\\n&= \\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}.\n\\end{align*}We want to find the remainder when this expression is divided by $1000$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, it suffices to find the remainders when this expression is divided by $8$ and $125$.\n\nFirst, we find the remainder when $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$ is divided by $8$. Since $7^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8}$, we have \\[7^{2005} \\equiv (7^2)^{1002} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 1^{1002} \\cdot 7 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8}.\\]Therefore, $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$ leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $8$.\n\nNext, we find the remainder when $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$ is divided by $125$. By Euler's Totient Theorem, we have $7^{100} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{125}$. Therefore, \\[7^{2005} \\equiv (7^{100})^{20} \\cdot 7^5 \\equiv 1^{20} \\cdot 7^5 \\equiv 7^5 \\equiv 49 \\cdot 49 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 24 \\cdot 7 \\equiv 168 \\equiv 43 \\pmod{125}.\\]Therefore, $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$ leaves a remainder of $43$ when divided by $125$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $\\frac{7^{2005}-1}{6}$ is divided by $1000$ is the unique residue modulo $1000$ that leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $8$ and a remainder of $43$ when divided by $125$. The only such residue is $\\boxed{543}$."}

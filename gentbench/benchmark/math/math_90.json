{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the greatest common divisor of $2^{1001}-1$ and $2^{1012}-1$?", "solution": "By the Euclidean algorithm, \\begin{align*}\n&\\text{gcd}\\,(2^{1012}-1, 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\, (2^{1012}-1 - 2^{11}(2^{1001}-1), 2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&\\qquad= \\text{gcd}\\,(2^{11}-1, 2^{1001}-1)\n\\end{align*} Using the divisibility rule for $11$, we know that $11$ divides into $1001$. Writing $2^{1001}$ as $(2^{11})^{91}$ and $1$ as $1^{91}$, we use the difference of odd powers factorization to find that   \\[\n2^{1001} - 1 = (2^{11})^{91}-1^{91} = (2^{11}-1)((2^{11})^{90} + (2^{11})^{89}+\\cdots (2^{11})^1 + 1).\n\\] Thus $2^{1001}-1$ is divisible by $2^{11}-1$, so the greatest common divisor is $2^{11}-1 = \\boxed{2047}$.", "pred": "Let $a = 2^{1001}-1$ and $b = 2^{1012}-1$. We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.\n\nStep 1: Divide $b$ by $a$ and find the remainder.\n\\begin{align*}\nb &= (2^{1012}-1) \\\\\n&= (2^{1001} \\cdot 2^{11}) - 1 \\\\\n&= (2^{1001}-1) \\cdot 2^{11} + (2^{11}-1)\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 2: Divide $a$ by the remainder from step 1 and find the new remainder.\n\\begin{align*}\na &= (2^{1001}-1) \\\\\n&= (2^{11}-1) \\cdot 2^{990} + (2^{990}-1)\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 3: Divide the remainder from step 1 by the remainder from step 2 and find the new remainder.\n\\begin{align*}\n(2^{11}-1) &= (2^{990}-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (2^2-1) \\\\\n&= 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nStep 4: Divide the remainder from step 2 by the remainder from step 3 and find the new remainder.\n\\begin{align*}\n(2^{990}-1) &= 3 \\cdot 2^2 + 3\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince the remainder is the same in steps 3 and 4, we can conclude that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is $3$."}

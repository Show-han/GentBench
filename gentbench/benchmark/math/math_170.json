{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The decimal representation of $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers and $m < n,$ contains the digits $2, 5$, and $1$ consecutively, and in that order. Find the smallest value of $n$ for which this is possible.\n", "solution": "To find the smallest value of $n$, we consider when the first three digits after the decimal point are $0.251\\ldots$.\nOtherwise, suppose the number is in the form of $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.X251 \\ldots$, where $X$ is a string of $k$ digits and $n$ is small as possible. Then $10^k \\cdot \\frac{m}{n} - X = \\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = 0.251 \\ldots$. Since $10^k m - nX$ is an integer and $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n}$ is a fraction between $0$ and $1$, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{10^k m - nX}{n} = \\frac{p}{q}$, where $q \\le n$. Then the fraction $\\frac pq = 0.251 \\ldots$ suffices.\nThus we have $\\frac{m}{n} = 0.251\\ldots$, or\n$\\frac{251}{1000} \\le \\frac{m}{n} < \\frac{252}{1000} \\Longleftrightarrow 251n \\le 1000m < 252n \\Longleftrightarrow n \\le 250(4m-n) < 2n.$\nAs $4m > n$, we know that the minimum value of $4m - n$ is $1$; hence we need $250 < 2n \\Longrightarrow 125 < n$. Since $4m - n = 1$, we need $n + 1$ to be divisible by $4$, and this first occurs when $n = \\boxed{127}$.", "pred": "We can start by writing out the decimal representation of $\\frac{m}{n}$: $$\\frac{m}{n} = 0.\\overline{a_1a_2a_3\\ldots a_k}.$$Since $m < n$, the decimal representation of $\\frac{m}{n}$ must be less than $1$. Therefore, $a_1$ must be $0$. We can then write $\\frac{m}{n}$ as $$\\frac{m}{n} = 0.a_1\\overline{a_2a_3\\ldots a_k}.$$Since $2, 5,$ and $1$ must appear consecutively and in that order, we know that $a_2 = 2$, $a_3 = 5$, and $a_4 = 1$. Therefore, $$\\frac{m}{n} = 0.0251\\overline{a_5a_6\\ldots a_k}.$$To find the smallest value of $n$, we want to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $0.0251\\overline{a_5a_6\\ldots a_k}$ is a terminating decimal. In other words, we want to find the smallest value of $k$ such that $0.0251\\overline{a_5a_6\\ldots a_k} = \\frac{251}{10000} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - 10^{-k}}$ is an integer. Since $251$ and $10000$ are relatively prime, $k$ must be a multiple of $4$. The smallest such value of $k$ is $k = \\boxed{4}$."}

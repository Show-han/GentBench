{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Kaleb defined a $\\emph{clever integer}$ as an even integer that is greater than 20, less than 120, and such that the sum of its digits is 9. What fraction of all clever integers is divisible by 27? Express your answer as a common fraction.", "solution": "You can easily list out the numbers between 20 and 120 that have digits that add to 9: 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 108, 117.\n\nTo be a $\\emph{clever integer}$ the number must be even, which leaves us with 36, 54, 72, 90, and 108, a total of 5 numbers.\n\nThe problem asks which fraction of these five clever integers are divisible by 27. Only two, 54 and 108 are divisible by 27, thus the total fraction is $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{5}}$.", "pred": "To find the fraction of clever integers that are divisible by 27, we need to count the number of clever integers that are divisible by 27 and divide it by the total number of clever integers.\n\nStep 1: Find the range of clever integers. The clever integers are greater than 20 and less than 120, so the range is from 21 to 119.\n\nStep 2: Find the number of clever integers. To find the number of clever integers, we need to count the number of even integers between 21 and 119 that have a digit sum of 9.\n\nStep 3: Find the number of clever integers divisible by 27. To find the number of clever integers divisible by 27, we need to count the number of even integers between 21 and 119 that have a digit sum of 9 and are divisible by 27.\n\nStep 4: Divide the number of clever integers divisible by 27 by the total number of clever integers to find the fraction.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\nStep 1: The range of clever integers is from 21 to 119.\n\nStep 2: To find the number of clever integers, we need to count the number of even integers between 21 and 119 that have a digit sum of 9. We can start by listing out the possible digits that can be used to form a number with a digit sum of 9: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Since the number is even, the units digit must be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. The tens digit can be any of the digits from the list. So, there are 5 choices for the units digit and 10 choices for the tens digit. This gives us a total of $5 \\times 10 = 50$ clever integers.\n\nStep 3: To find the number of clever integers divisible by 27, we need to count the number of even integers between 21 and 119 that have a digit sum of 9 and are divisible by 27. Since the digit sum is 9, the tens digit must be 9 and the units digit must be 0. So, there is only 1 clever integer that is divisible by 27.\n\nStep 4: Divide the number of clever integers divisible by 27 by the total number of clever integers to find the fraction. $\\frac{1}{50}$.\n\nTherefore, the fraction of all clever integers that are divisible by 27 is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{50}}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A standard six-sided die is rolled, and  $P$ is the product of the five numbers that are visible. What is the largest number that is certain to divide $P$?", "solution": "Since $6! = 720 = 2^4 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, the prime factors of $P$ can consist of at most 2's, 3's, and 5's.  The least possible number of 2's is two, which occurs when 4 is not visible. The least possible number of 3's is one, which occurs when either 3 or 6 is not visible, and the least number of 5's is zero, when 5 is not visible.  Thus $P$ must be divisible by $2^2\\cdot3 =\n\\boxed{12}$, but not necessarily by any larger number.", "pred": "The largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is the product of the three largest numbers on the die. This is because the product of any three numbers on the die will always be divisible by the product of the two smallest numbers. Since the three largest numbers on a standard six-sided die are $4$, $5$, and $6$, the largest number that is certain to divide $P$ is $4\\cdot 5\\cdot 6 = \\boxed{120}$."}

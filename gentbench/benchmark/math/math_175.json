{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Tom's graduating class has 288 students. At the graduation ceremony, the students will sit in rows with the same number of students in each row. If there must be at least 10 rows and at least 15 students in each row, then there can be $x$ students in each row. What is the sum of all possible values of $x$?", "solution": "If $x$ students sit in each row and there is a total of $y$ rows, then $xy=288=2^5\\cdot3^2$. Given that $x\\ge15$ and $y\\ge10$, the possible values for $x$ are $2^4=16$, $2^3\\cdot3=24$, and $2\\cdot3^2=18$. Their sum is $16+24+18=\\boxed{58}$.", "pred": "The number of students in each row must be a divisor of 288. The divisors of 288 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 288. However, there must be at least 15 students in each row, so the possible values of $x$ are 16, 18, 24, 32, 36, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 288. The sum of these values is $\\boxed{759}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The digits of a positive integer $n$ are four consecutive integers in decreasing order when read from left to right. What is the sum of the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$?", "solution": "A brute-force solution to this question is fairly quick, but we'll try something slightly more clever: our numbers have the form ${\\underline{(n+3)}}\\,{\\underline{(n+2)}}\\,{\\underline{( n+1)}}\\,{\\underline {(n)}}$$= 1000(n + 3) + 100(n + 2) + 10(n + 1) + n = 3210 + 1111n$, for $n \\in \\lbrace0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\rbrace$.\nNow, note that $3\\cdot 37 = 111$ so $30 \\cdot 37 = 1110$, and $90 \\cdot 37 = 3330$ so $87 \\cdot 37 = 3219$. So the remainders are all congruent to $n - 9 \\pmod{37}$. However, these numbers are negative for our choices of $n$, so in fact the remainders must equal $n + 28$.\nAdding these numbers up, we get $(0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) + 7\\cdot28 = \\boxed{217}$.", "pred": "Let the digits of $n$ be $a,$ $a-1,$ $a-2,$ and $a-3,$ where $a$ is a digit. Then $n = 1000a + 100(a-1) + 10(a-2) + (a-3) = 1111a - 123.$\n\nSince $0 \\le a \\le 9,$ $0 \\le 1111a - 123 \\le 9999.$ Therefore, the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ are $0,$ $1,$ $2,$ $\\dots,$ $9999 \\pmod{37}.$\n\nThe remainders $0,$ $1,$ $2,$ $\\dots,$ $36$ form a complete set of residues modulo $37,$ so the possible remainders when $n$ is divided by $37$ are $0,$ $1,$ $2,$ $\\dots,$ $36.$ The sum of these residues is $\\frac{36 \\cdot 37}{2} = \\boxed{666}.$"}

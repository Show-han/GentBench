{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The sum of two positive integers $a$ and $b$ is 1001.  What is the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$?", "solution": "Note that $\\gcd(a,b)$ divides both $a$ and $b$, so $\\gcd(a,b)$ must also divide $a + b = 1001$.  Clearly, $\\gcd(a,b)$ cannot be equal to 1001 (because both $a$ and $b$ must be less than 1001).  The next-largest divisor of 1001 is 143.  If $a = 143$ and $b = 1001 - 143 = 858$, then $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(143,858) = 143$.  Therefore, the largest possible value of $\\gcd(a,b)$ is $\\boxed{143}$.", "pred": "Let $d = \\gcd(a,b)$.  Then $a = dm$ and $b = dn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.  Substituting into $a + b = 1001$, we get $d(m + n) = 1001 = 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.  Since $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, $m + n$ must be a divisor of $1001$.\n\nThe largest divisor of $1001$ is $1001$, so $m + n = 1001$.  Then $m = 1001 - n$, so\n\\[a = d(1001 - n) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b = dn.\\]Since $a$ and $b$ are positive, $n < 1001$.  Also, $a$ and $b$ are positive, so $d > 0$.  Therefore, $d$ is a positive divisor of $1001$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $1001$ is $7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.  The largest divisor of $1001$ is $1001$, so the largest possible value of $d$ is $\\boxed{1001}$."}

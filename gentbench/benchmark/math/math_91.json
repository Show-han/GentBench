{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A certain integer has $4$ digits when written in base $8$. The same integer has $d$ digits when written in base $2$. What is the sum of all possible values of $d$?", "solution": "The smallest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $1000_8$, which stands for $8^3 = 2^9$. The largest integer that has $4$ digits in base $8$ is $7777_8$, which is $1$ less than $10000_8$ and therefore stands for $8^4-1 = 2^{12}-1$.\n\nThus, when a $4$-digit base-$8$ integer is written in base $2$, its highest place value is either $2^9$, $2^{10}$, or $2^{11}$. It follows that the base-$2$ expression has $10$, $11$, or $12$ digits, so the sum of all possible values for $d$ is $10+11+12 = \\boxed{33}$.", "pred": "The largest $4$-digit base $8$ number is $7777_8$, which is equal to $4095$ in base $10$. The smallest $4$-digit base $8$ number is $1000_8$, which is equal to $512$ in base $10$. Therefore, the integer in question is any integer from $512$ to $4095$, inclusive. \n\nTo find the number of digits in base $2$, we can find the smallest power of $2$ that is greater than $512$ and the largest power of $2$ that is less than $4095$. The smallest power of $2$ that is greater than $512$ is $2^9=512$, and the largest power of $2$ that is less than $4095$ is $2^{12}=4096$. Therefore, the integer in question has $9$ to $12$ digits in base $2$. \n\nThe sum of all possible values of $d$ is $9+10+11+12=\\boxed{42}$."}

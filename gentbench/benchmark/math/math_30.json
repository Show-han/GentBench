{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$?", "solution": "Note that $n^2-n=n(n-1)$ is divisible by $1$, $n-1$, and $n$. Since we want $n^2-n$ to be divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$, we must have $n-1>2$ so $n>3$. If $n=4$, $n$ is divisible by 2, so $n^2-n$ is divisible by all integer values of $k$ when $1\\le k\\le n$. Therefore, the least $n$ is $n=\\boxed{5}$.", "pred": "We can rewrite $n^2 - n$ as $n(n-1)$. \n\nFor $n$ to be the least positive integer such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$, there must exist an integer $k$ such that $n(n-1)$ is divisible by $k$, but not divisible by all integers less than $k$.\n\nSince $n(n-1)$ is divisible by $k$, we know that $k$ must be a factor of $n(n-1)$. \n\nTo minimize $n$, we want to find the smallest possible value of $k$ that is a factor of $n(n-1)$. \n\nThe smallest possible value of $k$ is $2$, because $2$ is the smallest positive integer greater than $1$. \n\nTherefore, $n(n-1)$ must be divisible by $2$. \n\nSince $n(n-1)$ is divisible by $2$, either $n$ or $n-1$ must be even. \n\nIf $n$ is even, then $n-1$ is odd. \n\nIf $n-1$ is even, then $n$ is odd. \n\nIn either case, one of $n$ or $n-1$ is even. \n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that $n^2 - n$ is divisible by some but not all integer values of $k$ when $1\\leq k \\leq n$ is $\\boxed{2}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For positive integers $n$, let $f(n)$ return the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. How many positive integer divisors does $f(2010)$ have?", "solution": "We will try to prove that $f(n) = 2^n$. Given that $f(n) = k$, we know that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. If we multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$, then all the digits are shifted $n$ places to the left, so we should end up with an integer that is not divisible by 10. Therefore, we want to find the smallest integer $k$ that divides $10^n$ and leaves a quotient that is not divisible by 10. If we let $k = 2^n$, then the quotient is $5^n$, which is odd and therefore not divisible by 10. For any integer smaller than $2^n$, the maximum power of 2 that can divide such an integer is $2^{n-1}$, so there remains at least one power of two that combines with a power of five to form an integer divisible by 10. Therefore, we have proved that $f(n) = 2^n$.\n\nAs a result, we can now conclude that $f(2010) = 2^{2010}$. The only integers that can divide $2^{2010}$ are $2^x$, for $0 \\le x \\le 2010$. There are $\\boxed{2011}$ such integers.", "pred": "To find $f(n)$, we need to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point. \n\nSince $\\frac{1}{k}$ is a fraction, it can have at most $k-1$ digits after the decimal point. Therefore, $f(n)$ must be greater than or equal to $n+1$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{1}{k}$ has exactly $n$ digits after the decimal point, we can multiply $\\frac{1}{k}$ by $10^n$ to move the decimal point $n$ places to the right. This gives us $\\frac{10^n}{k}$.\n\nWe want $\\frac{10^n}{k}$ to be an integer, so $k$ must be a divisor of $10^n$. Therefore, $f(n)$ is the smallest divisor of $10^n$ that is greater than or equal to $n+1$.\n\nTo find $f(2010)$, we need to find the smallest divisor of $10^{2010}$ that is greater than or equal to $2011$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $10^{2010}$ is $2^{2010} \\cdot 5^{2010}$. \n\nThe divisors of $10^{2010}$ are of the form $2^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $0 \\leq a \\leq 2010$ and $0 \\leq b \\leq 2010$.\n\nTo find the smallest divisor of $10^{2010}$ that is greater than or equal to $2011$, we need to find the smallest values of $a$ and $b$ such that $2^a \\cdot 5^b \\geq 2011$.\n\nSince $2^a$ and $5^b$ are both powers of $2$ and $5$, respectively, the smallest values of $a$ and $b$ that satisfy $2^a \\cdot 5^b \\geq 2011$ are $a=11$ and $b=2$.\n\nTherefore, $f(2010)$ is the smallest divisor of $10^{2010}$ that is greater than or equal to $2011$, which is $2^{11} \\cdot 5^2 = 20480$.\n\nThe number of positive integer divisors of $f(2010)$ is equal to the number of divisors of $20480$.\n\nThe prime factorization of $20480$ is $2^{11} \\cdot 5^2$.\n\nThe number of divisors of $20480$ is equal to $(11+1)(2+1) = 12 \\cdot 3 = \\boxed{36}$."}

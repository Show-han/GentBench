{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 which has two even and two odd digits?", "solution": "For a number to be divisible by 9, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.  But since the number has two even digits and two odd digits, the sum of its digits is even.  Thus the sum of its digits must be at least 18.  This number will be minimized if its thousands digit is 1 and its hundreds digit is 0.  This means the remaining two digits must sum to 17, and are hence 8,9.  So we see that the smallest possible integer of the desired form is $\\boxed{1089}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. The sum of the digits of a number divisible by 9 must also be divisible by 9.\n2. Since we need two even and two odd digits, the sum of the digits must be an even number.\n3. The smallest even number we can use is 2, and the smallest odd number is 1.\n4. We can start by placing the even digits in the thousands and hundreds place, and the odd digits in the tens and units place.\n5. The sum of the digits in the thousands and hundreds place must be divisible by 9. The smallest even digits that satisfy this condition are 2 and 4, which sum up to 6.\n6. The sum of the digits in the tens and units place must also be divisible by 9. The smallest odd digits that satisfy this condition are 1 and 3, which sum up to 4.\n7. Therefore, the smallest four-digit number that meets the given conditions is 6241.\n\nSo, the smallest positive four-digit number divisible by 9 with two even and two odd digits is 6241."}

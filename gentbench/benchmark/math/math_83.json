{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9?", "solution": "If $n$ is divisible by both 2 and 5, then we can write $n$ in the form $10^a \\cdot 2^b$ or $10^a \\cdot 5^b$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Since $10^a$ simply contributes trailing zeros, we can continue dividing by 10 until $n$ is a power of two or a power of 5. We generate a list of powers of 2. \\begin{align*}\n2^1 &= 2 \\\\\n2^2 &= 4 \\\\\n2^3 &= 8 \\\\\n2^4 &= 16 \\\\\n2^5 &= 32 \\\\\n2^6 &= 64 \\\\\n2^7 &= 128 \\\\\n2^8 &= 256 \\\\\n2^9 &= 512 \\\\\n2^{10} &= 1024 \\\\\n2^{11} &= 2048 \\\\\n2^{12} &= 4096\n\\end{align*}Therefore, we can conclude that $n \\le 4096$. Looking at the powers of 5, we note that the first five powers of five do not contain the digit 9, and since $5^6 = 15625$, the smallest integer that works is $n = \\boxed{4096}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9, we can start by considering the decimal representation of $\\frac{1}{n}$. \n\nA terminating decimal is a decimal that has a finite number of digits after the decimal point. This means that $\\frac{1}{n}$ can be written as $\\frac{a}{10^b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers.\n\nSince $n$ contains the digit 9, we know that $n$ must be a multiple of 9. This means that $n$ can be written as $9k$, where $k$ is an integer.\n\nSubstituting $n = 9k$ into $\\frac{1}{n}$, we get $\\frac{1}{9k} = \\frac{a}{10^b}$. Multiplying both sides by $10^b$, we have $\\frac{10^b}{9k} = a$.\n\nSince $a$ is an integer, $10^b$ must be divisible by 9. The smallest positive integer $b$ for which $10^b$ is divisible by 9 is $b = 1$. This means that $10^b = 10$, and $\\frac{10}{9k} = a$.\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{10}{9k}$ is an integer, we can start by considering the prime factorization of 10. The prime factorization of 10 is $2 \\cdot 5$.\n\nSince $k$ must be a multiple of 9, it cannot contain the prime factor 2. Therefore, $k$ must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe smallest positive integer $k$ that is a multiple of 5 is $k = 5$. Substituting $k = 5$ into $\\frac{10}{9k} = a$, we get $\\frac{10}{9 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{10}{45} = \\frac{2}{9}$. \n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $\\frac{1}{n}$ is a terminating decimal and $n$ contains the digit 9 is $n = 9k = 9 \\cdot 5 = \\boxed{45}$."}

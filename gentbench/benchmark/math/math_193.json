{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $N$ be the number of consecutive $0$'s at the right end of the decimal representation of the product $1!2!3!4!\\cdots99!100!.$ Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n", "solution": "A number in decimal notation ends in a zero for each power of ten which divides it. Thus, we need to count both the number of 5s and the number of 2s dividing into our given expression. Since there are clearly more 2s than 5s, it is sufficient to count the number of 5s.\nOne way to do this is as follows: $96$ of the numbers $1!,\\ 2!,\\ 3!,\\ 100!$ have a factor of $5$. $91$ have a factor of $10$. $86$ have a factor of $15$. And so on. This gives us an initial count of $96 + 91 + 86 + \\ldots + 1$. Summing this arithmetic series of $20$ terms, we get $970$. However, we have neglected some powers of $5$ - every $n!$ term for $n\\geq25$ has an additional power of $5$ dividing it, for $76$ extra; every n! for $n\\geq 50$ has one more in addition to that, for a total of $51$ extra; and similarly there are $26$ extra from those larger than $75$ and $1$ extra from $100$. Thus, our final total is $970 + 76 + 51 + 26 + 1 = 1124$, and the answer is $\\boxed{124}$.", "pred": "First, we can rewrite the product as $1! \\cdot 2! \\cdot 3! \\cdots 99! \\cdot 100! = (1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots 99 \\cdot 100)!$. \n\nNext, we want to find the number of consecutive zeros at the right end of this product. This is equivalent to finding the number of factors of $10$ in the product. \n\nA factor of $10$ is created by multiplying a factor of $2$ and a factor of $5$. Since there are clearly more factors of $2$ than factors of $5$ in the product, we just need to count the number of factors of $5$. \n\nTo do this, we can count the number of multiples of $5$, the number of multiples of $25$, and the number of multiples of $125$, and so on. \n\nThere are $100/5 = 20$ multiples of $5$ in the product. \n\nThere are $100/25 = 4$ multiples of $25$ in the product. \n\nThere is $100/125 = 0$ multiple of $125$ in the product. \n\nTherefore, the total number of factors of $5$ is $20 + 4 + 0 = 24$. \n\nThus, the number of consecutive zeros at the right end of the product is $24$. \n\nFinally, we find the remainder when $24$ is divided by $1000$. Since $24$ is less than $1000$, the remainder is $\\boxed{24}$."}

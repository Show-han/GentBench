{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: How many integers $N$ less than $1000$ can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers from exactly 5 values of $j\\ge 1$?\n", "solution": "Let the first odd integer be $2n+1$, $n\\geq 0$. Then the final odd integer is $2n+1 + 2(j-1) = 2(n+j) - 1$. The odd integers form an arithmetic sequence with sum $N = j\\left(\\frac{(2n+1) + (2(n+j)-1)}{2}\\right) = j(2n+j)$. Thus, $j$ is a factor of $N$.\nSince $n\\geq 0$, it follows that $2n+j \\geq j$ and $j\\leq \\sqrt{N}$.\nSince there are exactly $5$ values of $j$ that satisfy the equation, there must be either $9$ or $10$ factors of $N$. This means $N=p_1^2p_2^2$ or $N=p_1p_2^4$. Unfortunately, we cannot simply observe prime factorizations of $N$ because the factor $(2n+j)$ does not cover all integers for any given value of $j$.\nInstead we do some casework:\nIf $N$ is odd, then $j$ must also be odd. For every odd value of $j$, $2n+j$ is also odd, making this case valid for all odd $j$. Looking at the forms above and the bound of $1000$, $N$ must be\n\\[(3^2\\cdot5^2),\\ (3^2\\cdot7^2),\\ (3^4\\cdot5),\\ (3^4\\cdot7),\\ (3^4\\cdot 11)\\]\nThose give $5$ possibilities for odd $N$.\nIf $N$ is even, then $j$ must also be even. Substituting $j=2k$, we get\n\\[N = 4k(n+k) \\Longrightarrow \\frac{N}{4} = k(n+k)\\]\nNow we can just look at all the prime factorizations since $(n+k)$ cover the integers for any $k$. Note that our upper bound is now $250$:\n\\[\\frac{N}{4} = (2^2\\cdot3^2),(2^2\\cdot5^2),(2^2\\cdot7^2), (3^2\\cdot5^2), (2^4\\cdot3), (2^4\\cdot5), (2^4\\cdot7), (2^4\\cdot11), (2^4\\cdot13), (3^4\\cdot2)\\]\nThose give $10$ possibilities for even $N$.\nThe total number of integers $N$ is $5 + 10 = \\boxed{15}$.", "pred": "Let's consider the smallest possible value of $j$, which is $j=1$. In this case, the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers is just a single odd integer. Since we want to find integers $N$ that can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers from exactly 5 values of $j$, we need to find integers $N$ that can be written as a single odd integer in exactly 5 different ways.\n\nThe smallest odd integer less than $1000$ is $1$. So, $N=1$ is one possible value.\n\nNext, let's consider $j=2$. The sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers is the sum of two consecutive odd integers. The smallest possible sum is $1+3=4$. The largest possible sum less than $1000$ is $997+999=1996$. So, any odd integer between $4$ and $1996$ (inclusive) can be written as the sum of two consecutive positive odd integers. There are $997$ odd integers in this range. However, we need to exclude the odd integers that can be written as a single odd integer, since we already counted those in the previous case. So, there are $997-1=996$ odd integers that can be written as the sum of two consecutive positive odd integers.\n\nSimilarly, for $j=3$, the smallest possible sum is $1+3+5=9$ and the largest possible sum less than $1000$ is $993+995+997=2985$. Any odd integer between $9$ and $2985$ (inclusive) can be written as the sum of three consecutive positive odd integers. There are $993$ odd integers in this range, but we need to exclude the ones that can be written as a single odd integer or as the sum of two consecutive positive odd integers. So, there are $993-1-996=996$ odd integers that can be written as the sum of three consecutive positive odd integers.\n\nSimilarly, for $j=4$, the smallest possible sum is $1+3+5+7=16$ and the largest possible sum less than $1000$ is $989+991+993+995=3968$. Any odd integer between $16$ and $3968$ (inclusive) can be written as the sum of four consecutive positive odd integers. There are $989$ odd integers in this range, but we need to exclude the ones that can be written as a single odd integer, as the sum of two consecutive positive odd integers, or as the sum of three consecutive positive odd integers. So, there are $989-1-996-996=996$ odd integers that can be written as the sum of four consecutive positive odd integers.\n\nFinally, for $j=5$, the smallest possible sum is $1+3+5+7+9=25$ and the largest possible sum less than $1000$ is $985+987+989+991+993=4945$. Any odd integer between $25$ and $4945$ (inclusive) can be written as the sum of five consecutive positive odd integers. There are $985$ odd integers in this range, but we need to exclude the ones that can be written as a single odd integer, as the sum of two consecutive positive odd integers, as the sum of three consecutive positive odd integers, or as the sum of four consecutive positive odd integers. So, there are $985-1-996-996-996=996$ odd integers that can be written as the sum of five consecutive positive odd integers.\n\nIn summary, there are $1+996+996+996+996=\\boxed{3985}$ integers $N$ less than $1000$ that can be written as the sum of $j$ consecutive positive odd integers from exactly 5 values of $j\\ge 1$."}

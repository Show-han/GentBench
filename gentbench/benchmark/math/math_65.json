{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For positive integers $N$ and $k$, define $N$ to be $k$-nice if there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^{k}$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. Find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice.\n", "solution": "We claim that an integer $N$ is only $k$-nice if and only if $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$. By the number of divisors formula, the number of divisors of $\\prod_{i=1}^n p_i^{a_i}$ is $\\prod_{i=1}^n (a_i+1)$. Since all the $a_i$s are divisible by $k$ in a perfect $k$ power, the only if part of the claim follows. To show that all numbers $N \\equiv 1 \\pmod k$ are $k$-nice, write $N=bk+1$. Note that $2^{kb}$ has the desired number of factors and is a perfect kth power. By PIE, the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are either $1 \\pmod 7$ or $1\\pmod 8$ is $143+125-18=250$, so the desired answer is $999-250=\\boxed{749}$.", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are neither $7$-nice nor $8$-nice, we need to find the number of positive integers less than $1000$ that are not $7$-nice and not $8$-nice.\n\nTo find the number of positive integers that are $7$-nice, we need to find the number of positive integers $N$ such that there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^7$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors. We can rewrite this as finding the number of positive integers $N$ such that $N$ is the number of positive divisors of some number raised to the $7$th power. \n\nSimilarly, to find the number of positive integers that are $8$-nice, we need to find the number of positive integers $N$ such that there exists a positive integer $a$ such that $a^8$ has exactly $N$ positive divisors.

We can use the formula for the number of divisors of a positive integer to find this. The formula states that if the prime factorization of a positive integer is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n^{e_n}$, then the number of positive divisors is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_n + 1)$. Since $7$ is a prime number, the number of positive divisors of a number raised to the $7$th power is $8$ times the number of positive divisors of that number. Therefore, we need to find the number of positive integers $N$ such that $N$ is the number of positive divisors of some number. We can use the formula for the number of divisors of a positive integer to find this. The formula states that if the prime factorization of a positive integer is $p_1^{e_1} \\cdot p_2^{e_2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_n^{e_n}$, then the number of positive divisors is $(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \\ldots (e_n + 1)$. Since $7$ is a prime number, the number of positive divisors of a number raised to the $7$th power is $8$ times the number of positive divisors of that number.

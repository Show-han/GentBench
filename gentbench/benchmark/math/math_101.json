{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For how many pairs of consecutive integers in $\\{1000,1001,1002,\\ldots,2000\\}$ is no carrying required when the two integers are added?\n", "solution": "Consider what carrying means: If carrying is needed to add two numbers with digits $abcd$ and $efgh$, then $h+d\\ge 10$ or $c+g\\ge 10$ or $b+f\\ge 10$. 6. Consider $c \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. $1abc + 1ab(c+1)$ has no carry if $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This gives $5^3=125$ possible solutions.\nWith $c \\in \\{5, 6, 7, 8\\}$, there obviously must be a carry. Consider $c = 9$. $a, b \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ have no carry. This gives $5^2=25$ possible solutions. Considering $b = 9$, $a \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9\\}$ have no carry. Thus, the solution is $125 + 25 + 6=\\boxed{156}$.", "pred": "To determine if carrying is required when adding two integers, we need to look at the units digit of the first integer and the tens digit of the second integer. \n\nStep 1: Count the number of integers in the given set. There are $2000-1000+1=1001$ integers.\n\nStep 2: Consider the units digit of the first integer. It can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nStep 3: Consider the tens digit of the second integer. It can also be any digit from 0 to 9.\n\nStep 4: Since there are 10 possible choices for both the units digit and the tens digit, there are $10 \\times 10 = 100$ possible pairs of digits.\n\nStep 5: However, we need to exclude the pairs where carrying is required. Carrying is required when the sum of the units digit and the tens digit is greater than or equal to 10.\n\nStep 6: There are 10 pairs where the sum is 10: (0,10), (1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3), (8,2), (9,1).\n\nStep 7: There are 9 pairs where the sum is 11: (0,11), (1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3).\n\nStep 8: There are 8 pairs where the sum is 12: (0,12), (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5).\n\nStep 9: Continuing this pattern, there are 1 pair where the sum is 19: (9,10).\n\nStep 10: Adding up the number of pairs for each sum, we have $10+9+8+\\ldots+1 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 11}{2} = 55$ pairs where carrying is required.\n\nStep 11: Subtracting the number of pairs where carrying is required from the total number of pairs, we have $100-55 = \\boxed{45}$ pairs where no carrying is required."}

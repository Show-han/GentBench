{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $d_1 = a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$ and $d_2 = a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$. If $1 \\le a \\le 251$, how many integral values of $a$ are there such that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$?\n", "solution": "\\begin{align*}[(a^2 + 2^a) + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}][(a^2 + 2^a) - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}] &= (a^2 + 2^a)^2 - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2 \\cdot a^22^{a} + 2^{2a} - a^2 \\cdot 2^{a+1}\\\\ &= a^4 + 2^{2a}\\end{align*}\n(If you recall the reverse of Sophie Germain Identity with $a=a,\\, b = 2^{(a-1)/2}$, then you could have directly found the answer).\nBy Fermat's Little Theorem, we have that $a^{4} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 5$ and $a^{4} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ if $a | 5$. Also, we note that by examining a couple of terms, $2^{2a} \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$ if $a \\nmid 2$ and $2^{2a} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ if $a|2$. Therefore,\\[a^{4} + 2^{2a} \\equiv \\{0,1\\} + \\{1,4\\} \\equiv \\{0,1,2,4\\} \\pmod{5}\\]With divisibility by $5$ achievable only if $a \\nmid 2,5$. There are $\\frac{251-1}{2}+1 = 126$ odd numbers in the range given, and $\\frac{245-5}{10}+1 = 25$ of those are divisible by $5$, so the answer is $126 - 25 = \\boxed{101}$.", "pred": "First, we can factor $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ as $(a^2 + 2^a)^2 - (a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2})^2$. \n\nNext, we can use the difference of squares factorization to rewrite this expression as $(a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2})(a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2})$. \n\nSince we want $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ to be a multiple of $5$, one of the factors must be a multiple of $5$. \n\nFor the first factor, $a^2 + 2^a + a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$, we can see that $a^2$ is always a multiple of $5$ since $1 \\le a \\le 251$. \n\nFor the second factor, $a^2 + 2^a - a \\cdot 2^{(a+1)/2}$, we can see that $2^a$ is always a multiple of $5$ since $1 \\le a \\le 251$. \n\nTherefore, both factors are always multiples of $5$, so $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is always a multiple of $5$. \n\nSince $1 \\le a \\le 251$, there are $\\boxed{251}$ integral values of $a$ such that $d_1 \\cdot d_2$ is a multiple of $5$."}

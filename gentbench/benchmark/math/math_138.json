{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The sequence 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, $\\ldots$ consists of all positive multiples of 3 that contain at least one digit that is a 1. What is the $50^{\\mathrm{th}}$ term of the sequence?", "solution": "We know that the rule for divisibility by $3$ is that the digits of the number must add up to a multiple of $3$. So, it's clear that there are no other such two-digit numbers beyond the ones listed in the problem. Every number divisible by $3$ between $100$ and $199$ is in the sequence, so that gets us through the $39$th term of the sequence. Using the rule for divisibility by $3$, it is fairly simple to list out the remaining $11$ terms of the sequence: $201, 210, 213, 216, 219, 231, 261, 291, 312, 315, 318$. Thus, the $50$th term is $\\boxed{318}$.", "pred": "We can start listing out the terms of the sequence: 12, 15, 18, 21, 51, 81, 111, 114, 117, 120, 121, 123, 126, 129, 132, 135, 138, 141, 144, 147, 150, 151, 153, 156, 159, 162, 165, 168, 171, 174, 177, 180, 181, 183, 186, 189, 192, 195, 198, 201, 204, 207, 210, 211, 213, 216, 219, 222, 225, 228, 231, 234, 237, 240, 241, 243, 246, 249, 252, 255, 258, 261, 264, 267, 270, 271, 273, 276, 279, 282, 285, 288, 291, 294, 297, 300, 301, 303, 306, 309, 312, 315, 318, 321, 324, 327, 330, 331, 333, 336, 339, 342, 345, 348, 351, 354, 357, 360, 361, 363, 366, 369, 372, 375, 378, 381, 384, 387, 390, 391, 393, 396, 399, 402, 405, 408, 411, 414, 417, 420, 421, 423, 426, 429, 432, 435, 438, 441, 444, 447, 450, 451, 453, 456, 459, 462, 465, 468, 471, 474, 477, 480, 481, 483, 486, 489, 492, 495, 498, 501, 504, 507, 510, 511, 513, 516, 519, 522, 525, 528, 531, 534, 537, 540, 541, 543, 546, 549, 552, 555, 558, 561, 564, 567, 570, 571, 573, 576, 579, 582, 585, 588, 591, 594, 597, 600, 601, 603, 606, 609, 612, 615, 618, 621, 624, 627, 630, 631, 633, 636, 639, 642, 645, 648, 651, 654, 657, 660, 661, 663, 666, 669, 672, 675, 678, 681, 684, 687, 690, 691, 693, 696, 699, 702, 705, 708, 711, 714, 717, 720, 721, 723, 726, 729, 732, 735, 738, 741, 744, 747, 750, 751, 753, 756, 759, 762, 765, 768, 771, 774, 777, 780, 781, 783, 786, 789, 792, 795, 798, 801, 804, 807, 810, 811, 813, 816, 819, 822, 825, 828, 831, 834, 837, 840, 841, 843, 846, 849, 852, 855, 858, 861, 864, 867, 870, 871, 873, 876, 879, 882, 885, 888, 891, 894, 897, 900, 901, 903, 906, 909, 912, 915, 918, 921, 924, 927, 930, 931, 933, 936, 939, 942, 945, 948, 951, 954, 957, 960, 961, 963, 966, 969, 972, 975, 978, 981, 984, 987, 990, 991"}

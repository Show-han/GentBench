{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square.", "solution": "Since $15 \\mid 15n$, and $15$ is square-free, we must have $15^2 \\mid 15n$, so $15 \\mid n$. Say $n=15a$. Then $15^2 a = 15n$ is a square, and conversely, if $a$ is a square, then $15^2 a$ is a square. Thus we are counting the number of positive squares $a$ such that $15a \\le 1000$ or $a \\le \\frac{200}{3} \\approx 66.6$. The largest such square is $64=8^2$, so the possible values of $a$ are $b^2$ for $b=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8$, giving $\\boxed{8}$ possible values of $a$ (and hence 8 possible values for $n$).", "pred": "To find the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with $n = 1$.\n2. Calculate $15n$.\n3. Check if $15n$ is a perfect square.\n4. If $15n$ is a perfect square, increment a counter by 1.\n5. Increment $n$ by 1.\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until $n$ reaches 1000.\n7. The final value of the counter is the number of positive integers $n \\le 1000$ such that $15n$ is a perfect square.\n\nNote: To check if a number is a perfect square, we can take its square root and check if the square root is an integer."}

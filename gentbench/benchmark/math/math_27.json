{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: For any integer $n>1$, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is:\n$\\text{(A) } 0\\quad\\qquad \\text{(B) } 1\\quad\\\\ \\text{(C) } \\frac{n}{2} \\text{ for n even, } \\frac{n+1}{2} \\text{ for n odd}\\quad\\\\ \\text{(D) } n-1\\quad \\text{(E) } n$\n", "solution": "Observe that for all $k \\in 1< k< n$, since $k$ divides $n!$, $k$ also divides $n!+k$. Therefore, all numbers $a$ in the range $n!+1<a<n!+n$ are composite. Therefore there are $\\boxed{}$ primes in that range.", "pred": "We can rewrite $n!+1$ as $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdots(n-1)\\cdot n+1$. Notice that $n!+1$ is not divisible by any number from $2$ to $n$, inclusive, so it is possible that $n!+1$ is prime. However, $n!+n$ is divisible by $n$, so it is not prime. Therefore, the number of prime numbers greater than $n!+1$ and less than $n!+n$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1}$."}

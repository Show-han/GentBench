{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: A relatively prime date is a date for which the number of the month and the number of the day are relatively prime. For example, June 17 is a relatively prime date because the greatest common factor of 6 and 17 is 1. How many relatively prime dates are in the month with the fewest relatively prime dates?", "solution": "Since exactly 1 in every $n$ consecutive dates is divisible by $n$, the month with the fewest relatively prime days is the month with the greatest number of distinct small prime divisors. This reasoning gives us June ($6=2\\cdot3$) and December ($12=2^2\\cdot3$). December, however, has one more relatively prime day, namely December 31, than does June, which has only 30 days. Therefore, June has the fewest relatively prime days. To count how many relatively prime days June has, we must count the number of days that are divisible neither by 2 nor by 3. Out of its 30 days, $\\frac{30}{2}=15$ are divisible by 2 and $\\frac{30}{3}=10$ are divisible by 3. We are double counting the number of days that are divisible by 6, $\\frac{30}{6}=5$ days. Thus, June has $30-(15+10-5)=30-20=\\boxed{10}$ relatively prime days.", "pred": "To find the month with the fewest relatively prime dates, we need to calculate the number of relatively prime dates for each month. \n\n1. January has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n2. February has 28 days (or 29 in a leap year), so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 28 (or 29). \n3. March has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n4. April has 30 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 30. \n5. May has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n6. June has 30 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 30. \n7. July has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n8. August has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n9. September has 30 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 30. \n10. October has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n11. November has 30 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 30. \n12. December has 31 days, so we need to check the number of relatively prime dates for each day from 1 to 31. \n\nAfter calculating the number of relatively prime dates for each month, we can determine the month with the fewest relatively prime dates."}

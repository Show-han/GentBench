{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The infinite sequence $S=\\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\\ldots\\}$ is defined by $s_1=7$ and $s_n=7^{s_{n-1}}$ for each integer $n>1$. What is the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$?", "solution": "Another way of writing the sequence $S$ is $\\{7,7^7,7^{7^7},7^{7^{7^7}},\\ldots\\}$. We wish to determine the $100^{\\text{th}}$ term of this sequence modulo $5$.\n\nNote that $s_{100} = 7^{s_{99}}\\equiv 2^{s_{99}}\\pmod 5$. In order to determine the remainder of $2^{s_{99}}$ when divided by $5$, we look for a pattern in the powers of $2$ modulo $5$. Computing a few powers of $2$ yields \\[\\{2^0,2^1,2^2,2^3,2^4,\\ldots\\}\\equiv \\{1,2,4,3,1,\\ldots\\}\\pmod 5.\\]So we have a cyclic pattern $1,2,4,3$ of length $4$ (this is called a period). Now we need to determine where $2^{s_{99}}$ falls in the cycle; to do that, we must determine the residue of $s_{99}\\pmod 4$, since the cycle has length $4$.\n\nNote that \\begin{align*}\n7&\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^7&\\equiv (-1)^7 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n7^{7^7}&\\equiv (-1)^{7^7}\\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4,\\\\\n&\\vdots\n\\end{align*}Continuing in this manner, we always have $s_n \\equiv 3\\pmod 4$. Thus, $s_{100} = 2^{s_{99}} \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv \\boxed{3}\\pmod 5$.", "pred": "We can find the remainder when $s_{100}$ is divided by $5$ by finding the pattern of the remainders when dividing each term of the sequence by $5$. \n\nWe start by finding the remainder when $s_1=7$ is divided by $5$. Since $7$ divided by $5$ leaves a remainder of $2$, we have $s_1\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$.\n\nNext, we find the remainder when $s_2=7^{s_1}$ is divided by $5$. Since $s_1\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}$, we have $s_2\\equiv 7^2\\equiv 49\\equiv 4\\pmod{5}$.\n\nContinuing in this way, we find the remainders when dividing the next few terms of the sequence by $5$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ns_3&\\equiv 7^{s_2}\\equiv 7^4\\equiv 2401\\equiv 1\\pmod{5}, \\\\\ns_4&\\equiv 7^{s_3}\\equiv 7^1\\equiv 7\\equiv 2\\pmod{5}, \\\\\ns_5&\\equiv 7^{s_4}\\equiv 7^2\\equiv 49\\equiv 4\\pmod{5}, \\\\\ns_6&\\equiv 7^{s_5}\\equiv 7^4\\equiv 2401\\equiv 1\\pmod{5}.\n\\end{align*}We see that the remainders repeat in a cycle of length $4$. Since $100$ is divisible by $4$, we have $s_{100}\\equiv s_4\\equiv \\boxed{2}\\pmod{5}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: The integer $n$ is the largest positive multiple of $15$ such that every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$. Compute $\\frac{n}{15}$.\n", "solution": "Any multiple of 15 is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3.\nAny multiple of 5 ends in 0 or 5; since $n$ only contains the digits 0 and 8, the units digit of $n$ must be 0.\nThe sum of the digits of any multiple of 3 must be divisible by 3. If $n$ has $a$ digits equal to 8, the sum of the digits of $n$ is $8a$. For this number to be divisible by 3, $a$ must be divisible by 3. We also know that $a>0$ since $n$ is positive. Thus $n$ must have at least three copies of the digit 8.\nThe smallest number which meets these two requirements is 8880. Thus the answer is $\\frac{8880}{15} = \\boxed{592}$.", "pred": "Since $n$ is a multiple of $15$, it must be divisible by both $3$ and $5$. Since every digit of $n$ is either $8$ or $0$, the sum of the digits of $n$ is a multiple of $8$. Therefore, the sum of the digits of $\\frac{n}{15}$ is a multiple of $8$. The largest multiple of $8$ that is less than $100$ is $96$, so the sum of the digits of $\\frac{n}{15}$ is $96$. Since $\\frac{n}{15}$ is a multiple of $3$, it must be divisible by $3$ if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by $3$. Therefore, the sum of the digits of $\\frac{n}{15}$ is divisible by $3$ if and only if $\\frac{n}{15}$ is divisible by $3$. Since the sum of the digits of $\\frac{n}{15}$ is $96$, we conclude that $\\frac{n}{15}$ is divisible by $3$. Therefore, $\\frac{n}{15}$ is a multiple of $3$ that is less than $100$, so the largest possible value of $\\frac{n}{15}$ is $\\boxed{96}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Ed and Sue bike at equal and constant rates. Similarly, they jog at equal and constant rates, and they swim at equal and constant rates. Ed covers $74$ kilometers after biking for $2$ hours, jogging for $3$ hours, and swimming for $4$ hours, while Sue covers $91$ kilometers after jogging for $2$ hours, swimming for $3$ hours, and biking for $4$ hours. Their biking, jogging, and swimming rates are all whole numbers of kilometers per hour. Find the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates.\n", "solution": "Let the biking rate be $b$, swimming rate be $s$, jogging rate be $j$, all in km/h.\nWe have $2b + 3j + 4s = 74,2j + 3s + 4b = 91$. Subtracting the second from twice the first gives $4j + 5s = 57$. Mod 4, we need $s\\equiv1\\pmod{4}$. Thus, $(j,s) = (13,1),(8,5),(3,9)$.\n$(13,1)$ and $(3,9)$ give non-integral $b$, but $(8,5)$ gives $b = 15$. Thus, our answer is $15^{2} + 8^{2} + 5^{2} = \\boxed{314}$.", "pred": "Let $b$, $j$, and $s$ be Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates, respectively. We are given the following equations:\n\\[2b+3j+4s=74\\]\n\\[4b+2j+3s=91\\]\nMultiplying the first equation by $2$ and the second equation by $3$ gives:\n\\[4b+6j+8s=148\\]\n\\[12b+6j+9s=273\\]\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation gives:\n\\[8b+0j+(-1)s=125\\]\nSince $b$, $j$, and $s$ are all whole numbers, we know that $s$ must be a multiple of $125$. Since $s$ is a rate, it must be positive, so $s=125$. Substituting this back into the first equation gives:\n\\[8b+0j+(-1)(125)=125\\]\n\\[8b=250\\]\n\\[b=31.25\\]\nSince $b$ must be a whole number, we know that $b$ must be $31$. Substituting this back into the first equation gives:\n\\[2(31)+3j+4(125)=74\\]\n\\[62+3j+500=74\\]\n\\[3j=-488\\]\n\\[j=-162.67\\]\nSince $j$ must be a whole number, we know that $j$ must be $-162$. However, since $j$ represents a rate, it must be positive, so $j=162$. Therefore, the sum of the squares of Ed's biking, jogging, and swimming rates is $31^2+162^2+125^2=\\boxed{37250}$."}

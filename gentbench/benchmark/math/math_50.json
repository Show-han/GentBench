{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $p$ and $q$ be positive integers such that\\[\\frac{5}{9} < \\frac{p}{q} < \\frac{4}{7}\\]and $q$ is as small as possible. What is $q-p$?\n$\\textbf{(A) } 7 \\qquad \\textbf{(B) } 11 \\qquad \\textbf{(C) } 13 \\qquad \\textbf{(D) } 17 \\qquad \\textbf{(E) } 19$\n", "solution": "We claim that, between any two fractions $a/b$ and $c/d$, if $bc-ad=1$, the fraction with smallest denominator between them is $\\frac{a+c}{b+d}$. To prove this, we see that\n\\[\\frac{1}{bd}=\\frac{c}{d}-\\frac{a}{b}=\\left(\\frac{c}{d}-\\frac{p}{q}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{p}{q}-\\frac{a}{b}\\right) \\geq \\frac{1}{dq}+\\frac{1}{bq},\\]which reduces to $q\\geq b+d$. We can easily find that $p=a+c$, giving an answer of $\\boxed{7}$.", "pred": "We can start by finding a common denominator for $\\frac{5}{9}$ and $\\frac{4}{7}$. The least common multiple of $9$ and $7$ is $63$, so we can rewrite the given inequality as\\[\\frac{35}{63} < \\frac{p}{q} < \\frac{36}{63}.\\]Since $q$ is as small as possible, we want to find the smallest positive integer $q$ such that $\\frac{p}{q}$ is between $\\frac{35}{63}$ and $\\frac{36}{63}$. We can do this by finding the smallest positive integer $q$ such that $p$ is between $35$ and $36$. Since $p$ is an integer, the smallest possible value of $p$ is $36$. Therefore, the smallest possible value of $q$ is $q = 63$, and $q-p = 63-36 = \\boxed{27}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Suppose that $n$ is a positive integer such that in base $7$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{ABC}_7$, and in base $11$, then $n$ can be expressed as $\\overline{CBA}_{11}$. Find the largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$.", "solution": "We convert $n$ to base $10$. The base $7$ expression implies that $n = 49A + 7B + C$, and the base $11$ expression implies that $n = 121C + 11B + A$. Setting the two expressions equal to each other yields that $$n = 49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A \\Longrightarrow 48A - 4B - 120C = 0.$$Isolating $B$, we get $$B = \\frac{48A - 120C}{4} = 12A - 30C = 6(2A - 5C).$$It follows that $B$ is divisible by $6$, and since $B$ is a base $7$ digit, then $B$ is either $0$ or $6$. If $B$ is equal to $0$, then $2A - 5C = 0 \\Longrightarrow 2A = 5C$, so $A$ must be divisible by $5$ and hence must be either $0$ or $5$. Since $n$ is a three-digit number in base $7$, then $A \\neq 0$, so $A = 5$ and $C = 2$. Thus, $n = 502_7 = 5 \\cdot 7^2 + 2 = 247$.\n\nIf $B$ is equal to $6$, then $2A - 5C = 1$, so $2A - 1 = 5C$ and $2A - 1$ must be divisible by 5. Since $A$ is a base $7$ digit, it follows that $A = 3$ and $C = 1$. This yields the value $n = 361_7 = 3 \\cdot 7^2 + 6 \\cdot 7 + 1 = 190$. The largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$ is $\\boxed{247}$.", "pred": "In base $7$, the number $\\overline{ABC}_7$ can be expressed as $A \\cdot 7^2 + B \\cdot 7^1 + C \\cdot 7^0$. In base $10$, this is equivalent to $49A + 7B + C$.\n\nIn base $11$, the number $\\overline{CBA}_{11}$ can be expressed as $C \\cdot 11^2 + B \\cdot 11^1 + A \\cdot 11^0$. In base $10$, this is equivalent to $121C + 11B + A$.\n\nSince $n$ is the same number expressed in both bases, we have $49A + 7B + C = 121C + 11B + A$.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get $48A + 4B = 120C$, or $12A + B = 30C$.\n\nSince $A$, $B$, and $C$ are all digits in their respective bases, we know that $A$, $B$, and $C$ must be integers between $0$ and $6$ inclusive.\n\nTo maximize $n$, we want to maximize $A$, $B$, and $C$. Since $12A + B = 30C$, we want to maximize $C$ and minimize $A$ and $B$.\n\nThe largest possible value of $C$ is $6$. If $C = 6$, then $12A + B = 180$, which means $A = 14$ and $B = 12$. However, $A$ and $B$ must be between $0$ and $6$ inclusive, so this is not a valid solution.\n\nThe next largest possible value of $C$ is $5$. If $C = 5$, then $12A + B = 150$, which means $A = 12$ and $B = 6$. This is a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $n$ in base $10$ is $49A + 7B + C = 49 \\cdot 12 + 7 \\cdot 6 + 5 = \\boxed{599}$."}

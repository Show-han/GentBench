Substituting these values results in\\[a^2 - b^2 = 55\\]Factor the difference of squares to get\\[(a + b)(a - b) = 55\\]If $y < 0$, then $55 + 3^{2y} < 64$, so $y$ can not be negative. If $x < 0$, then $2^{2x} < 1$. Since $3^{2y}$ is always positive, the result would be way less than $55$, so $x$ can not be negative. Thus, $x$ and $y$ have to be nonnegative, so $a$ and $b$ are integers. Thus,\\[a+b=55 \\text{ and } a-b=1\\]\\[\\text{or}\\]\\[a+b=11 \\text{ and } a-b=5\\]From the first case, $a = 28$ and $b = 27$. Since $2^x = 28$ does not have an integral solution, the first case does not work. From the second case, $a = 8$ and $b = 3$. Thus, $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. Thus, there is only $\\boxed{1}$ solution.", "pred": "First, we can rewrite the equation as $4^x - 9^y = 55$. Taking the equation modulo $9$, we have $(-1)^x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{9}$. This means that $x$ must be even. Let $x = 2a$. Then, we have $16^a - 9^y = 55$. Taking this equation modulo $16$, we have $(-1)^y \\equiv 7 \\pmod{16}$. This means that $y$ must be odd. Let $y = 2b + 1$. Then, we have $16^a - 9(81^b) = 55$. Taking this equation modulo $81$, we have $(-1)^a \\equiv 55 \\pmod{81}$. This means that $a$ must be odd. Let $a = 2c + 1$.

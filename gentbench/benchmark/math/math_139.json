{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Find the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$.", "solution": "We first need to find the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16! = 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times \\cdots \\times 2 \\times 1$. There are $8$ even numbers less than or equal to $16$, which contribute a power of $2^8$; of these, $4$ are divisible by $4$ and contribute an additional power of $2^4$; two are divisible by $8$ and contributes an additional power of $2^2$; and finally, one is divisible by $16$ and contributes an additional power of $2$. In total, the largest power of $2$ that divides into $16!$ is equal to $2^{8+4+2+1} = 2^{15}$.\n\nChecking the ones digits of the powers of $2$, we see that the ones digit of $2^1$ is $2$, of $2^2$ is $4$, of $2^3$ is $8$, of $2^4$ is $6$, and of $2^5$ is $2$. Thus, the ones digit will repeat every $4$ exponents, and the ones digit of $2^{15} = 2^{4 \\times 3 + 3}$ is the same as the ones digit of $2^3 = \\boxed{8}$.", "pred": "To find the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$, we need to determine the highest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$. \n\nStep 1: Determine the number of factors of $2$ in $(2^4)!$. \nSince $(2^4)! = 16!$, we need to count the number of factors of $2$ in $16!$. \n\nStep 2: Count the number of factors of $2$ in each number from $1$ to $16$. \nWe can do this by dividing each number by $2$ and counting the number of times we can divide evenly. \n\nStep 3: Add up the number of factors of $2$ for each number from $1$ to $16$. \nThis will give us the total number of factors of $2$ in $16!$. \n\nStep 4: Determine the highest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$. \nTo do this, we need to find the largest power of $2$ that is a factor of $16!$. \n\nStep 5: Find the ones digit of the highest power of $2$. \nTo find the ones digit of the highest power of $2$, we need to determine the remainder when the highest power of $2$ is divided by $10$. \n\nTherefore, the ones digit of the largest power of $2$ that divides into $(2^4)!$ is $\\boxed{6}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Ten identical crates each of dimensions $3\\mathrm{ft}\\times 4\\mathrm{ft}\\times 6\\mathrm{ft}$. The first crate is placed flat on the floor. Each of the remaining nine crates is placed, in turn, flat on top of the previous crate, and the orientation of each crate is chosen at random. Let $\\frac {m}{n}$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $41\\mathrm{ft}$ tall, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m$.\n", "solution": "Only the heights matter, and each crate is either 3, 4, or 6 feet tall with equal probability. We have the following:\n\\begin{align*}3a + 4b + 6c &= 41\\\\ a + b + c &= 10\\end{align*}\nSubtracting 3 times the second from the first gives $b + 3c = 11$, or $(b,c) = (2,3),(5,2),(8,1),(11,0)$. The last doesn't work, obviously. This gives the three solutions $(a,b,c) = (5,2,3),(3,5,2),(1,8,1)$. In terms of choosing which goes where, the first two solutions are analogous.\nFor $(5,2,3),(3,5,2)$, we see that there are $2\\cdot\\dfrac{10!}{5!2!3!} = 10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7$ ways to stack the crates. For $(1,8,1)$, there are $2\\dbinom{10}{2} = 90$. Also, there are $3^{10}$ total ways to stack the crates to any height.\nThus, our probability is $\\dfrac{10\\cdot9\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 90}{3^{10}} = \\dfrac{10\\cdot8\\cdot7 + 10}{3^{8}} = \\dfrac{570}{3^8} = \\dfrac{190}{3^{7}}$. Our answer is the numerator, $\\boxed{190}$.", "pred": "We can solve this problem using recursion. Let $P(n)$ be the probability that the stack of crates is exactly $n$ feet tall. We want to find $P(41)$.\n\nConsider the top crate in the stack. It can be placed in one of three orientations: standing up, lying on its side, or upside down. \n\nIf the top crate is standing up, then the remaining stack must be $n-6$ feet tall. So the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{3}P(n-6)$.\n\nIf the top crate is lying on its side, then the remaining stack must be $n-4$ feet tall. So the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{3}P(n-4)$.\n\nIf the top crate is upside down, then the remaining stack must be $n-3$ feet tall. So the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{3}P(n-3)$.\n\nTherefore, we have the recursion $P(n) = \\frac{1}{3}P(n-6) + \\frac{1}{3}P(n-4) + \\frac{1}{3}P(n-3)$.\n\nWe can use this recursion to find $P(41)$. Starting with $P(0) = 1$ (since the stack can be 0 feet tall), we can compute $P(1), P(2), \\dots, P(41)$ using the recursion. The final answer is $P(41)$.\n\nUsing a computer program or spreadsheet, we can find that $P(41) = \\frac{1}{3^{41}} \\approx 1.45 \\times 10^{-20}$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{1}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $m$ be the product of all positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$. Find the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$.\n\n(Here $n!$ denotes $1\\times\\cdots\\times n$ for each positive integer $n$.)", "solution": "We compute that $4!=1\\times 2\\times 3\\times 4 = 2^{3}\\times 3=24$. So we want exactly the numbers in the set $\\{1,\\ldots,24\\}$ which are divisible by neither $2$ nor $3$, since an integer $a$ is invertible modulo $n$ for some positive integer $n$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,n)=1$.

An integer $a$ is invertible modulo $4!$ if and only if $\\gcd(a,4!)=1$. Since $4!=24=2^3\\cdot3$, we need $\\gcd(a,2)=1$ and $\\gcd(a,3)=1$. \n\nThe positive integers less than $4!$ which are divisible by $2$ are $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, $10$, $12$, $14$, $16$, $18$, $20$, $22$, and $24$. Out of these, only $3$, $9$, $15$, $21$, and $24$ are not invertible modulo $4!$. \n\nThe positive integers less than $4!$ which are divisible by $3$ are $3$, $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, $18$, $21$, and $24$. Out of these, only $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, $10$, $14$, $16$, $20$, and $22$ are not invertible modulo $4!$. \n\nTherefore, the positive integers less than $4!$ which are invertible modulo $4!$ are $1$, $5$, $7$, $11$, $13$, $17$, $19$, and $23$. \n\nThe product of these numbers is $1\\cdot5\\cdot7\\cdot11\\cdot13\\cdot17\\cdot19\\cdot23=243\\cdot437\\cdot19\\cdot23$. \n\nTo find the remainder when this product is divided by $4!$, we can take the remainder of each factor modulo $4!$ and then multiply them together. \n\nTaking the remainder of each factor modulo $4!$, we have $243\\equiv3\\pmod{4!}$, $437\\equiv13\\pmod{4!}$, $19\\equiv19\\pmod{4!}$, and $23\\equiv23\\pmod{4!}$. \n\nTherefore, the remainder when $m$ is divided by $4!$ is $3\\cdot13\\cdot19\\cdot23\\equiv\\boxed{3}\\pmod{4!}$."}

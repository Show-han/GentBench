{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: When the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers are multiplied, the product is 180. How many different values could be the greatest common divisor of the two integers?", "solution": "We know that $\\gcd(a,b) \\cdot \\mathop{\\text{lcm}}[a,b] = ab$ for all positive integers $a$ and $b$.  Hence, in this case, $ab = 180$.  The prime factorization of 180 is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $a = 2^p \\cdot 3^q \\cdot 5^r$ and $b = 2^s \\cdot 3^t \\cdot 5^u$ for some nonnegative integers $p$, $q$, $r$, $s$, $t$, and $u$.  Then $ab = 2^{p + s} \\cdot 3^{q + t} \\cdot 5^{r + u}$.  But $ab = 180 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5$, so $p + s = 2$, $q + t = 2$, and $r + u = 1$.\n\nWe know that $\\gcd(a,b) = 2^{\\min\\{p,s\\}} \\cdot 3^{\\min\\{q,t\\}} \\cdot 5^{\\min\\{r,u\\}}$.  The possible pairs $(p,s)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{p,s\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(q,t)$ are $(0,2)$, $(1,1)$, and $(2,0)$, so the possible values of $\\min\\{q,t\\}$ are 0 and 1.  The possible pairs $(r,u)$ are $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$, so the only possible value of $\\min\\{r,u\\}$ is 0.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $\\gcd(a,b)$ are $2^0 \\cdot 3^0 = 1$, $2^1 \\cdot 3^0 = 2$, $2^0 \\cdot 3^1 = 3$, and $2^1 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$, for a total of $\\boxed{4}$ possible values.", "pred": "1. Let's assume the two integers are x and y.\n2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y can be any positive integer that divides both x and y.\n3. The least common multiple (LCM) of x and y can be any positive integer that is divisible by both x and y.\n4. The product of the GCD and LCM is 180, so GCD * LCM = 180.\n5. We need to find the number of different values that the GCD can take.\n6. Since GCD * LCM = 180, we can rewrite it as GCD = 180 / LCM.\n7. The LCM can take different values, which will result in different values for the GCD.\n8. To find the possible values of the GCD, we need to find the factors of 180.\n9. The factors of 180 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, and 180.\n10. Therefore, there are 18 different values that could be the GCD of the two integers."}

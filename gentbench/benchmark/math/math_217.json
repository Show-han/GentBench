{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: It is known that, for all positive integers $k$,\n$1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^{2}=\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}6$.\nFind the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $1^2+2^2+3^2+\\ldots+k^2$ is a multiple of $200$.\n", "solution": "$\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$ if $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is a multiple of $1200 = 2^4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5^2$. So $16,3,25|k(k+1)(2k+1)$.\nSince $2k+1$ is always odd, and only one of $k$ and $k+1$ is even, either $k, k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{16}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 15 \\pmod{16}$.\nIf $k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k$. If $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|2k+1$. If $k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$, then $3|k+1$.\nThus, there are no restrictions on $k$ in $\\pmod{3}$.\nIt is easy to see that only one of $k$, $k+1$, and $2k+1$ is divisible by $5$. So either $k, k+1, 2k+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{25}$.\nThus, $k \\equiv 0, 24, 12 \\pmod{25}$.\nFrom the Chinese Remainder Theorem, $k \\equiv 0, 112, 224, 175, 287, 399 \\pmod{400}$. Thus, the smallest positive integer $k$ is $\\boxed{112}$.", "pred": "We want to find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$ is a multiple of $200$. \n\nFirst, we simplify the expression $\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}$. \n\nSince $200 = 2^3 \\cdot 5^2$, we want to find the smallest $k$ such that $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is divisible by $2^3$ and $5^2$. \n\nFor $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ to be divisible by $2^3$, either $k$ or $k+1$ must be divisible by $2$. \n\nIf $k$ is divisible by $2$, then $k+1$ must be odd, so $2k+1$ is odd. \n\nIf $k+1$ is divisible by $2$, then $k$ must be odd, so $2k+1$ is odd. \n\nTherefore, $2k+1$ is always odd, so $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is divisible by $2^3$ for all positive integers $k$. \n\nNext, we consider the divisibility by $5^2$. \n\nIf $k$ is divisible by $5$, then $k+1$ is not divisible by $5$, so $2k+1$ is not divisible by $5$. \n\nIf $k+1$ is divisible by $5$, then $k$ is not divisible by $5$, so $2k+1$ is not divisible by $5$. \n\nTherefore, $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is not divisible by $5^2$ for any positive integer $k$. \n\nSince $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is divisible by $2^3$ but not by $5^2$, the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $k(k+1)(2k+1)$ is divisible by $200$ is $\\boxed{5}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $T = \\{9^k : k ~ \\mbox{is an integer}, 0 \\le k \\le 4000\\}$. Given that $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and that its first (leftmost) digit is 9, how many elements of $T$ have 9 as their leftmost digit?\n", "solution": "Since $9^{4000}$ has 3816 digits more than $9^1$, $4000 - 3816 = \\boxed{184}$ numbers have 9 as their leftmost digits.", "pred": "To find the number of elements in $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit, we need to determine the range of values of $k$ for which $9^k$ has 9 as its leftmost digit.\n\nSince $9^{4000}$ has 3817 digits and its first digit is 9, we know that $9^{4000}$ is between $9 \\times 10^{3816}$ and $10 \\times 10^{3816}$.\n\nTo find the range of values of $k$, we can take the logarithm base 10 of both sides of the inequality:\n\n$\\log_{10}(9^{4000})$ is between $\\log_{10}(9 \\times 10^{3816})$ and $\\log_{10}(10 \\times 10^{3816})$.\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can simplify this to:\n\n$4000 \\log_{10}(9)$ is between $\\log_{10}(9) + 3816$ and $\\log_{10}(10) + 3816$.\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(9)$ is positive, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $\\log_{10}(9)$:\n\n$4000$ is between $1 + \\frac{3816}{\\log_{10}(9)}$ and $1 + \\frac{3817}{\\log_{10}(9)}$.\n\nTo find the number of elements in $T$ that have 9 as their leftmost digit, we need to find the number of integers between $1 + \\frac{3816}{\\log_{10}(9)}$ and $1 + \\frac{3817}{\\log_{10}(9)}$.\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(9)$ is approximately 0.9542, we can calculate:\n\n$1 + \\frac{3816}{\\log_{10}(9)}$ is approximately 4000.5.\n\n$1 + \\frac{3817}{\\log_{10}(9)}$ is approximately 4001.5.\n\nTherefore, there is only one element in $T$ that has 9 as its leftmost digit."}

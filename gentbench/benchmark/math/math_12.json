{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Let $a_n$ be the integer obtained by writing all the integers from $1$ to $n$ from left to right. For example, $a_3 = 123$ and $a_{11} = 1234567891011$. Compute the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$.", "solution": "We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem as follows: We will compute the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$. The remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 will be the residue (mod 45) which leaves the same remainders when divided by 5 and 9 as $a_{44}$ does. Since $a_{44}$ ends in $4$, it gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$.\n\nFor the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 9, note that  \\begin{align*}\na_{44}&=44+43\\cdot 10^2 + 42 \\cdot 10^4+41\\cdot 10^6+\\cdots+10\\cdot10^{68}\\\\\n&\\qquad+9\\cdot 10^{70}+8\\cdot 10^{71}+\\cdots + 1\\cdot 10^{78} \\\\ &\\equiv 44+43+42+\\cdots+1\\pmod{9},\n\\end{align*}since $10^n\\equiv 1^n\\equiv 1\\pmod{9}$ for all nonnegative integers $n$. In words, this calculation shows that we can sum groups of digits in any way we choose to check for divisibility by 9. For example, 1233 is divisible by 9 since $12+33=45$ is divisible by 9. This is a generalization of the rule that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Getting back to the problem at hand, we sum $44+43+\\cdots+1$ using the formula $1+2+\\cdots+n=n(n+1)/2$ to find that $a_{44}$ is divisible by 9.\n\nWe are looking for a multiple of $9$ that gives a remainder of $4$ when divided by $5$. Nine satisfies this condition, so the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by 45 is $\\boxed{9}$.", "pred": "First, we note that $45 = 5 \\cdot 9$. \n\nTo find the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$, we can find the remainders when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ and $9$ separately, and then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine them.\n\nTo find the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$, we can look at the last digit of $a_{44}$. Since $44$ is divisible by $4$, the last two digits of $a_{44}$ are divisible by $4$, so the last digit of $a_{44}$ is $0$. Therefore, $a_{44}$ is divisible by $5$, and the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $5$ is $\\boxed{0}$.\n\nTo find the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $9$, we can look at the sum of the digits of $a_{44}$. Since $44$ is divisible by $9$, the sum of the digits of $a_{44}$ is divisible by $9$. The sum of the digits of $a_{44}$ is $1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + \\dots + 4 + 4 = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 9 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + \\dots + 4 + 4 = \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} + 1 + 1 + \\dots + 4 + 4 = 45 + 1 + 1 + \\dots + 4 + 4 = 45 + \\frac{4 \\cdot 5}{2} = 45 + 10 = 55$. Therefore, the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $9$ is $55 \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{9}$.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the remainder when $a_{44}$ is divided by $45$ is the unique remainder between $0$ and $45$ that is congruent to $0$ modulo $5$ and congruent to $1$ modulo $9$. The only such remainder is $\\boxed{1}$."}

{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Each of two boxes contains both black and white marbles, and the total number of marbles in the two boxes is $25.$ One marble is taken out of each box randomly. The probability that both marbles are black is $27/50,$ and the probability that both marbles are white is $m/n,$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m + n$?\n", "solution": "If we work with the problem for a little bit, we quickly see that there is no direct combinatorics way to calculate $m/n$. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion still requires us to find the individual probability of each box.\nLet $a, b$ represent the number of marbles in each box, and without loss of generality let $a>b$. Then, $a + b = 25$, and since the $ab$ may be reduced to form $50$ on the denominator of $\\frac{27}{50}$, $50|ab$. It follows that $5|a,b$, so there are 2 pairs of $a$ and $b: (20,5),(15,10)$.\nCase 1: Then the product of the number of black marbles in each box is $54$, so the only combination that works is $18$ black in first box, and $3$ black in second. Then, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{2}{20} \\cdot \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{25},$ so $m + n = 26$.\nCase 2: The only combination that works is 9 black in both. Thus, $P(\\text{both white}) = \\frac{1}{10}\\cdot \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{1}{25}$. $m + n = 26$.\nThus, $m + n = \\boxed{26}$.", "pred": "Let $b_1$ and $w_1$ be the number of black and white marbles in the first box, and $b_2$ and $w_2$ be the number of black and white marbles in the second box. We are given that $b_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25$ and $\\frac{b_1}{b_1 + w_1} \\cdot \\frac{b_2}{b_2 + w_2} = \\frac{27}{50}.$\n\nWe can rewrite the second equation as $\\frac{b_1 \\cdot b_2}{(b_1 + w_1)(b_2 + w_2)} = \\frac{27}{50}.$ Cross-multiplying gives $50b_1b_2 = 27(b_1 + w_1)(b_2 + w_2).$\n\nExpanding the right side gives $50b_1b_2 = 27(b_1b_2 + b_1w_2 + b_2w_1 + w_1w_2).$ Rearranging gives $23b_1b_2 = 27b_1w_2 + 27b_2w_1 + 27w_1w_2.$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $23b_1b_2 - 27b_1w_2 - 27b_2w_1 + 27w_1w_2 = 0.$ Factoring out a $9$ gives $9(23b_1b_2 - 3b_1w_2 - 3b_2w_1 + 3w_1w_2) = 0.$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $23(b_1b_2 - \\frac{3}{23}b_1w_2 - \\frac{3}{23}b_2w_1 + \\frac{3}{23}w_1w_2) = 0.$\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as $23((b_1 - \\frac{3}{23}w_1)(b_2 - \\frac{3}{23}w_2)) = 0.$\n\nSince $23$ is prime, either $b_1 - \\frac{3}{23}w_1 = 0$ or $b_2 - \\frac{3}{23}w_2 = 0.$\n\nIf $b_1 - \\frac{3}{23}w_1 = 0,$ then $b_1 = \\frac{3}{23}w_1.$ Substituting into $b_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25$ gives $\\frac{3}{23}w_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25.$ Rearranging gives $b_2 + w_2 = 25 - \\frac{26}{23}w_1.$ Since $b_2$ and $w_2$ are positive integers, $25 - \\frac{26}{23}w_1$ must be a positive integer. The only possible value of $w_1$ is $23,$ which gives $b_2 + w_2 = 25 - \\frac{26}{23} \\cdot 23 = 25 - 26 = -1,$ which is not a positive integer. Therefore, $b_1 - \\frac{3}{23}w_1 \\neq 0.$\n\nTherefore, $b_2 - \\frac{3}{23}w_2 = 0.$ Substituting into $b_1 + w_1 + b_2 + w_2 = 25$ gives $b_1 + w_1 + \\frac{3}{23}w_2 + w_2 = 25.$ Rearranging gives $b_1 + w_1 = 25 - \\frac{26}{23}w_2.$ Since $b_1$ and $w_1$ are positive integers, $25 - \\frac{26}{23}w_2$ must be a positive integer. The only possible value of $w_2$ is $23,$ which gives $b_1 + w_1 = 25 - \\frac{26}{23} \\cdot 23 = 25 - 26 = -1,$ which is not a positive integer.

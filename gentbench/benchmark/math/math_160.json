{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: Suppose $a$ is an integer such that $0 \\le a \\le 14$, and $235935623_{74}-a$ is a multiple of $15$. What is $a$?", "solution": "Note that $235935623_{74}=3+2(74)+6(74)^2+5(74)^3+3(74)^4+9(74)^5+5(74)^6$ $+3(74)^7+2(74)^8$. But $74 \\equiv -1 \\mod{15}$, so this is just $3-2+6-5+3-9+5-3+2=0 \\mod{15}$, so $a=\\boxed{0}$.", "pred": "We know that a number is divisible by $15$ if and only if it is divisible by both $3$ and $5$. \n\nTo check if a number is divisible by $3$, we can add up its digits and see if the sum is divisible by $3$. \n\nTo check if a number is divisible by $5$, we can look at its units digit and see if it is either $0$ or $5$. \n\nSince $235935623_{74}$ is a base $74$ number, we need to convert it to base $10$ to perform these checks. \n\nTo convert $235935623_{74}$ to base $10$, we can use the place value system. The rightmost digit is the units digit, the next digit to the left is the $74$'s digit, the next digit to the left is the $74^2$'s digit, and so on. \n\nConverting $235935623_{74}$ to base $10$, we have:\n\n$2 \\cdot 74^8 + 3 \\cdot 74^7 + 5 \\cdot 74^6 + 9 \\cdot 74^5 + 3 \\cdot 74^4 + 5 \\cdot 74^3 + 6 \\cdot 74^2 + 2 \\cdot 74^1 + 3 \\cdot 74^0$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$2 \\cdot 74^8 + 3 \\cdot 74^7 + 5 \\cdot 74^6 + 9 \\cdot 74^5 + 3 \\cdot 74^4 + 5 \\cdot 74^3 + 6 \\cdot 74^2 + 2 \\cdot 74^1 + 3 \\cdot 74^0 = 235935623$\n\nNow, we can check if $235935623$ is divisible by $15$. \n\nAdding up the digits of $235935623$, we get:\n\n$2 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 2 + 3 = 38$\n\nSince $38$ is not divisible by $3$, $235935623$ is not divisible by $15$. \n\nTherefore, there is no value of $a$ that satisfies the given conditions."}

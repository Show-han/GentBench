{"problem": "Think step by step and answer in short: What is the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $n^2$ is divisible by 18 and $n^3$ is divisible by 640?", "solution": "Note firstly that $18 = 2 \\cdot 3^2$, so $n$ must be divisible by both $2$ and $3$. Furthermore, $640 = 2^7 \\cdot 5$, so $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$ and $5$, since the smallest power of 2 that, when cubed, is no smaller than $2^7$ is $2^3$. Therefore, $n$ must be divisible by $2^3$, $3$, and $5$. Note that $2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 120$ is the smallest possible integer that satisfies all of these conditions, so we have $n = \\boxed{120}$.", "pred": "To find the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 640. \n\nThe prime factorization of 18 is $2 \\cdot 3^2$. \nThe prime factorization of 640 is $2^7 \\cdot 5$. \n\nTo find the LCM, we take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization. \n\nFor the prime factor 2, the highest power is $2^7$. \nFor the prime factor 3, the highest power is $3^2$. \nFor the prime factor 5, the highest power is $5^1$. \n\nTherefore, the LCM of 18 and 640 is $2^7 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 = 5760$. \n\nSo, the smallest positive integer $n$ that satisfies both conditions is $\\boxed{60}$."}
